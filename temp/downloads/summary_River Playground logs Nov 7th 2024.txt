[00:00:00 - 00:00:05] cool and pray to the tech gods that everything works because it's a it's a
[00:00:05 - 00:00:11] proof of concepts right now it's not a finished product that's in part why
[00:00:15 - 00:00:22] service level agreements. So it's like, no, you have to do it over again. Right now you can't connect.
[00:00:22 - 00:00:28] But yeah, I can. Yeah. Do you want to start or do we go here first? No, we go there first, right?
[00:00:28 - 00:00:30] Because we all...
[00:00:30 - 00:00:33] check in with who we are, but not why we're here.
[00:00:33 - 00:00:35] Well, we did slightly, but.
[00:00:38 - 00:00:40] So what are you going to do now?
[00:00:40 - 00:00:41] Full screen?
[00:00:45 - 00:00:58] Jag borde gå och rapportera om det.
[00:01:00 - 00:01:15] okay but I know how we can do that we're not the tech company that's good enough
[00:01:15 - 00:01:17] This is your first slide, right?
[00:01:17 - 00:01:18] Yeah?
[00:01:18 - 00:01:19] No?
[00:01:19 - 00:01:20] This is the first slide.
[00:01:20 - 00:01:21] Yeah.
[00:01:21 - 00:01:22] This one.
[00:01:22 - 00:01:24] Yeah, so I'll just go through the frames.
[00:01:24 - 00:01:29] So our idea of the objective that we invite you to,
[00:01:29 - 00:01:31] and playfully.
[00:01:30 - 00:01:37] explore it within and around it is to demonstrate what we call AI augmentation.
[00:01:37 - 00:01:45] So how can we feel more, feel experience and use more of the human connectedness.
[00:01:45 - 00:01:52] and then generate insights, hopefully, that can, yeah, leverage or help River forward.
[00:01:52 - 00:02:00] So insights that through exploring what River's potential is in practice.
[00:02:00 - 00:02:05] practice, what are insights facilitating that, what are possible outcomes, how can we contribute
[00:02:05 - 00:02:06] to that?
[00:02:06 - 00:02:12] So it's more like it's the touching point between what River needs here now and what,
[00:02:12 - 00:02:14] if anything, we want to contribute with.
[00:02:15 - 00:02:20] It's an exploration of that from an individual perspective, but also a collaborative perspective.
[00:02:20 - 00:02:25] And yeah, AI is in the room, so she will listen, we will ask for reflections, we can do it
[00:02:25 - 00:02:27] like ad hoc whenever we want.
[00:02:27 - 00:02:30] We have a few places where we think that that might be a good thing.
[00:02:30 - 00:02:36] idea so yeah that's the invitation
[00:02:45 - 00:03:00] we didn't do the check-in. We said hello. So we're going to do the check-in. Proper check-in. Yeah, proper check-in. We have some personal questions that we're going to circle around into two rounds, so we get to know each other a little bit more.
[00:03:00 - 00:03:12] Yeah, we're going to explore a few questions that connect the river and then summarize
[00:03:12 - 00:03:15] with learnings from that and see where that wants to go basically.
[00:03:15 - 00:03:23] That's it. And we also have a few principles that we invite everyone to and that is
[00:03:25 - 00:03:30] Try to practice listening deeply like where am I right now?
[00:03:30 - 00:03:35] now, what's happening in the room, what is not being visible, what is made visible,
[00:03:35 - 00:03:42] try to tune in on multiple levels. We really want it to be playful, so we can
[00:03:42 - 00:03:47] all come in with curiosity, which I think is a term that
[00:03:45 - 00:03:52] we might not use too seriously. So it's more like playful seriousness in a
[00:03:52 - 00:03:56] sense. Like when you're curious you're actually exploring a new possibility
[00:03:56 - 00:04:02] space. So like can we do that playfully? That's like yeah.
[00:04:00 - 00:04:15] There is potential in between the nodes, or between the lines, like what's in the room that we're not seeing, not exploring, that is kind of its own thing.
[00:04:15 - 00:04:21] own thing. So can we tap into that and feel that and play with that energy. So
[00:04:21 - 00:04:29] that's the imitation. Does that feel like something we want to stand behind?
[00:04:30 - 00:04:41] All right, so that's the first check-in question.
[00:04:41 - 00:04:45] We forgot to add the image, so we can do it now.
[00:04:45 - 00:05:00] So before we do the check-in, should we just like put our feet on the ground and close our eyes and just like land, praying to the Shakyas that it will work and that we can be just
...
...
...
...
[00:06:00 - 00:06:02] come to the circle.
[00:06:02 - 00:06:04] Nice.
[00:06:06 - 00:06:08] Okay.
[00:06:08 - 00:06:10] So the first
[00:06:10 - 00:06:12] check-in question
[00:06:12 - 00:06:14] is something like this
[00:06:14 - 00:06:16] What in your life
[00:06:15 - 00:06:30] is important and valuable. I get the honors to start and then I'm going to send it to, I think actually Aditya, if it's okay. So can you be number two? Yeah.
[00:06:31 - 00:06:41] I would say the most important thing in my life is to be connected to my heart and to my body
[00:06:41 - 00:06:46] and to always have the ones that I care for and love.
[00:06:46 - 00:07:01] love close at heart and always to be present for them and I have two young adults in my life. I have my daughter she's 23 and I have my son he's 26 and being
[00:07:01 - 00:07:10] hair on this planet together with them and coaching them into this crazy lovely world
[00:07:10 - 00:07:16] I think is my biggest job and it's always going to be my most important.
[00:07:16 - 00:07:21] and most valuable thing that I will ever do.
[00:07:21 - 00:07:22] Yeah.
[00:07:22 - 00:07:23] Okay, Aditya.
[00:07:25 - 00:07:27] Thank you.
[00:07:27 - 00:07:27] Thank you.
[00:07:31 - 00:07:42] At a really tangible level, my family, my home, my cat, are all important and valuable to me.
[00:07:42 - 00:07:46] At a deeper level, there's...
[00:07:46 - 00:07:56] something I'm feeling around what's alive or what's true I don't mean true
[00:07:56 - 00:08:02] like a concept like what's and what can we feel
[00:08:01 - 00:08:09] as in our awareness right now. It could be personally or as a society about a
[00:08:09 - 00:08:15] relationship to life, to the earth, to ecosystems.
[00:08:16 - 00:08:22] And it's something I want to cultivate in myself, a sense of the preciousness of this
[00:08:22 - 00:08:31] moment and a sense of consciousness in stepping forward into speech and action.
[00:08:31 - 00:08:38] Thank you. We're sending forward to Stefan.
[00:08:38 - 00:08:40] Okay, nice.
[00:08:43 - 00:08:46] Yeah, I'm going to start with the earthly matters too.
[00:08:46 - 00:08:57] So my partner Helen and I, we have a four-year-old who is a really beautiful human being.
[00:08:57 - 00:09:01] And it's like when it's...
[00:09:01 - 00:09:06] The baby's coming. It's it's I mean there's a lot of love and it's a baby
[00:09:06 - 00:09:12] but when they grow up and become like a person and you start relating to them and
[00:09:12 - 00:09:16] Ask me difficult questions, and he knows when
[00:09:16 - 00:09:20] didn't do a thing that I told him I was going to do and it's like there's this
[00:09:20 - 00:09:26] real he remembers stuff yeah I just I just love him I love our family I love
[00:09:26 - 00:09:33] Helen and it's difficult to to
[00:09:31 - 00:09:41] raise a toddler while also raising another baby who's two years old, like being this
[00:09:41 - 00:09:46] entrepreneur or if you want to call it something else.
[00:09:46 - 00:09:55] I tend to forget that life is happening right now, but right now I can feel that, really feel that.
[00:09:57 - 00:10:00] And also, I just want to mirror somewhat what you said.
[00:10:01 - 00:10:10] The present moment is so rich, it's so rich, and we tend to maybe not see that, or neglect that, or forget that.
[00:10:10 - 00:10:16] Life is really precious and, yeah, so...
[00:10:16 - 00:10:27] full in every moment and just honoring that I think is probably important so I
[00:10:27 - 00:10:33] find those two spheres right now they're very connected.
[00:10:31 - 00:10:36] So, yeah, I'll stop there.
[00:10:37 - 00:10:38] Thank you.
[00:10:38 - 00:10:39] Thank you.
[00:10:39 - 00:10:40] Send it over to Jenny.
[00:10:40 - 00:10:41] Thank you very much.
[00:10:42 - 00:10:45] Okay, so what's important in my life?
[00:10:45 - 00:10:46] I think,
[00:10:46 - 00:10:55] For me, I think that we are only here for a certain period of time.
[00:10:55 - 00:10:59] We're very, sort of, fragile in a way.
[00:10:59 - 00:11:01] So for me...
[00:11:01 - 00:11:09] doing good is really important. So if I come to this world and I'm leaving this
[00:11:09 - 00:11:15] world, I want to make it a better place. And that could be in a lot of dimensions.
[00:11:15 - 00:11:18] But that...
[00:11:16 - 00:11:26] comes with a lot of courage. So I think courage is really important. It's also
[00:11:26 - 00:11:33] about hearing or staying true to yourself and
[00:11:31 - 00:11:37] really having that balance between, you know, I want to do good and believing in
[00:11:37 - 00:11:43] that. So another thing that I think is really important, really valuable, is hope.
[00:11:43 - 00:11:48] Because you need to
[00:11:46 - 00:11:52] be very hopeful in order to think that you do good. You really need to have a lot of hope or faith you
[00:11:52 - 00:12:01] can also say. So for me those values are very important. So I want to do good, I want to
[00:12:02 - 00:12:08] leave this world knowing that I did something good. And sometimes that means
[00:12:08 - 00:12:15] just starting with your closest swear. And for me my closest swear is of course
[00:12:15 - 00:12:18] my children.
[00:12:17 - 00:12:24] So, they go first, no matter what, I mean, I would do anything and I would, you know,
[00:12:24 - 00:12:26] that is so important.
[00:12:26 - 00:12:32] So if I can bring forward two beautiful people in this world doing good.
[00:12:32 - 00:12:38] that is something a really good legacy so I think a lot of effort or I do a lot
[00:12:38 - 00:12:46] of effort to make them sending them off being improving this world and then in
[00:12:46 - 00:12:49] my daily life
[00:12:47 - 00:12:52] also trying to do good and have that and have the courage to stay with that.
[00:12:52 - 00:12:57] It's a lot of time I feel like a youthful out there, you know, I feel very different from a
[00:12:57 - 00:13:03] lot of people because they don't seem to think or cherish.
[00:13:02 - 00:13:06] that yeah so over to you
[00:13:10 - 00:13:15] yeah i'm moved by your sharing it's beautiful to get to know you in this way so quickly it's
[00:13:15 - 00:13:17] yes great i love that
[00:13:17 - 00:13:23] And what's really valuable to me, I'm gonna pick up one of the words you used, was good.
[00:13:23 - 00:13:30] And to me it's a sense of being connected to things that feels good in my body at all times.
[00:13:30 - 00:13:32] And it's an aspect that's really...
[00:13:32 - 00:13:38] concrete to me it's not to have it fluffy but it's also really deep in the spiritual aspect of this
[00:13:38 - 00:13:46] place in me that's always good it's always still and always this lingering tingling joyful touch
[00:13:46 - 00:13:47] of it and to have
[00:13:47 - 00:13:55] one foot at least in that experience at the same time as looking out through these eyes and enjoy
[00:13:55 - 00:14:02] this existence this world and because if i don't feel the good i
[00:14:02 - 00:14:07] start to get strategic and start to get fearful. I start to live a life fear based and I've done
[00:14:07 - 00:14:14] that so long and it's not nice at all and I start to act really weird relating to my
[00:14:14 - 00:14:17] deepest values. So to be true to me I need
[00:14:17 - 00:14:20] to be firstly connected to what's good in me.
[00:14:20 - 00:14:22] That's super valuable.
[00:14:22 - 00:14:25] Everything I've asked, even if I try to love someone,
[00:14:25 - 00:14:28] if I try to love someone, I don't actually love,
[00:14:28 - 00:14:31] it's still this aspect of me trying to something,
[00:14:31 - 00:14:32] trying to do something.
[00:14:32 - 00:14:40] And I become desperate and attached and I can't play I lose the playfulness things get important
[00:14:40 - 00:14:47] So that's how now I'm lost and drunk in my mind. I started feel things are important in a way that's
[00:14:47 - 00:14:52] I feel this is super important, but it's in a joyful, like, land of grace.
[00:14:52 - 00:14:56] So I think that's the core, and also I love this body.
[00:14:56 - 00:14:59] Just to be in a body, it's so good.
[00:14:59 - 00:15:01] It's so good.
[00:15:01 - 00:15:02] And to play with it.
[00:15:02 - 00:15:09] and to see the world with it and to move, exercise everything, be out in the forest, run, breathe,
[00:15:09 - 00:15:16] like face plant in water, do everything, like it's just such a beautiful thing to experience with.
[00:15:16 - 00:15:17] So be connected.
[00:15:17 - 00:15:20] Connected and having a healthy body is important.
[00:15:20 - 00:15:22] Thank you.
[00:15:22 - 00:15:24] Ah, and connection is valuable.
[00:15:24 - 00:15:26] Relationship.
[00:15:26 - 00:15:28] Relational connection.
[00:15:28 - 00:15:32] To have this authentic, truthful touch.
[00:15:32 - 00:15:38] in what we do. It makes me feel
[00:15:38 - 00:15:45] landed, which I really enjoy. Safe. Thank you.
[00:15:47 - 00:16:01] Like three weeks ago, when I was here, I shared that this partnership was breaking up, and
[00:16:01 - 00:16:02] this process has been.
[00:16:03 - 00:16:16] been super painful since then and like I have not had access to the place you described
[00:16:16 - 00:16:18] of goodness in me or like feeling
[00:16:18 - 00:16:30] good a lot of the time and instead I've had a lot of access to fear feeling
[00:16:30 - 00:16:34] super vulnerable in relation to this change
[00:16:33 - 00:16:42] And it feels super valuable and important to have, like I'm so grateful to have the
[00:16:42 - 00:16:48] space in my life not to have to run away from that right now.
[00:16:48 - 00:16:56] Like, not having access to the goodness, because there's so much activation in the body, and
[00:16:56 - 00:16:58] really taking the time.
[00:16:58 - 00:17:01] It's so wonderful to let...
[00:17:03 - 00:17:12] to let it become warm to let it melt and then to just hope that without strategy
[00:17:12 - 00:17:20] because that's definitely not the way to solve it like that the chance to find
[00:17:18 - 00:17:26] find another partner and do the family thing that is so critical to, like my dreams will
[00:17:26 - 00:17:27] come.
[00:17:27 - 00:17:32] But to like, the pain in me feels really important right now, or like the fear in me.
[00:17:33 - 00:17:40] like it feels like this cathartic or alchemical or something going on. Like a
[00:17:40 - 00:17:45] way to not repeat the same loops that I come from.
[00:17:45 - 00:17:49] Thank you.
[00:17:48 - 00:18:03] I think from the person that is the most important person to me is my daughter, she's almost
[00:18:03 - 00:18:03] 20.
[00:18:03 - 00:18:17] twenty now. I separated from her mom, it's almost ten years now, but initially we were
[00:18:17 - 00:18:18] really really close.
[00:18:18 - 00:18:23] all the time. We managed to keep that working but eventually I got into a new
[00:18:23 - 00:18:28] relationship and then it was more difficult to maintain that closeness
[00:18:28 - 00:18:35] with my daughter. They didn't match so to say.
[00:18:33 - 00:18:48] So, we lost it a little bit, but over the last couple of years, one, one and a half year, we've started to reconnect and rebuild our relationship again, and build our relationship, not
[00:18:48 - 00:18:55] built on what we were, or what it should be to be the father-daughter, but what is the
[00:18:55 - 00:19:03] relationship that works for us where we are right now. And that's been great.
[00:19:03 - 00:19:13] So for me, that's really the only person that truly is the one that I not only care about,
[00:19:13 - 00:19:18] but the one that is the most important, the one I will never ever forget.
[00:19:18 - 00:19:29] again so that's number one the other thing is that when I joined River I also
[00:19:29 - 00:19:35] River invited me through the people in River but also through
[00:19:33 - 00:19:38] the whole principle of reverb to something that I've been missing for a long long time.
[00:19:39 - 00:19:46] I've been angry, frustrated, irritated on everything from organizations with their
[00:19:46 - 00:19:48] heads stuck up their ass don't understanding what
[00:19:48 - 00:19:55] what you're really doing, short-sighted, a meta-world that is not really working anymore,
[00:19:55 - 00:19:57] systems that are breaking down.
[00:19:57 - 00:19:59] So that was only angry and frustrated.
[00:19:59 - 00:20:03] It was like, what am I going to do, go out in the street and wave a flag or be...
[00:20:03 - 00:20:14] just pissed. So what I was missing was basically a place that I felt had people, had visions, ideas
[00:20:15 - 00:20:18] that what we could not only talk about but we could also act on.
[00:20:18 - 00:20:29] So I've gone from being pissed off to being optimistic about it and also seeing that we
[00:20:29 - 00:20:33] have possibilities to actually make serious impact.
[00:20:33 - 00:20:50] on extremely complex and societal levels using these technologies like AI, but also the Web3 blockchain, the decentralized technologies that
[00:20:48 - 00:20:55] I didn't have them when I was pissed. Now we have them, so I don't have to be pissed.
[00:20:55 - 00:21:03] And I think also one super important thing for me is that I've decided not to do things that do not feel good.
[00:21:03 - 00:21:10] feel right to my body. I don't do things because others say that's the right way to do it,
[00:21:10 - 00:21:15] when I know that they're wrong. And there is a huge difference in meeting people, because
[00:21:15 - 00:21:18] you meet a lot of people, and the people you actually connect with.
[00:21:19 - 00:21:22] And the people you connect with are where it makes a difference.
[00:21:22 - 00:21:26] So if it doesn't connect, why waste time on it?
[00:21:26 - 00:21:31] I don't need more business cards, I don't need to be a famous guy on the wall somewhere.
[00:21:31 - 00:21:34] I just want to connect with the right people where I can.
[00:21:34 - 00:21:42] we can make serious difference and over the first one and a half years I've
[00:21:42 - 00:21:48] actually started to learn how to use my body to take decisions and not take
[00:21:48 - 00:21:51] decisions
[00:21:49 - 00:21:57] from the brain. And that's both scary, but it's also refreshing. So it's always super
[00:21:57 - 00:22:04] nice to be with people who create that feeling and energy. So thanks for that.
[00:22:04 - 00:22:05] Thank you.
[00:22:05 - 00:22:06] So nice.
[00:22:06 - 00:22:07] Thank you.
[00:22:07 - 00:22:08] Okay.
[00:22:08 - 00:22:09] I have a question.
[00:22:09 - 00:22:14] We kind of answered the second chicken question, and I'm mindful of time, so I'm just ... It's
[00:22:14 - 00:22:18] a question if we should, so that's open to the group.
[00:22:19 - 00:22:26] The first question was what is important and the second round would be why.
[00:22:26 - 00:22:33] So maybe we could do like a short circle and not go so deep or be so long.
[00:22:33 - 00:22:33] So more...
[00:22:34 - 00:22:44] A few words and just emphasise the what and the why, is that okay?
[00:22:44 - 00:22:47] It's okay, can I come in and play with this question?
[00:22:47 - 00:22:49] Yeah, go ahead.
[00:22:49 - 00:22:54] hearing you and starting to feel you in that one and like what would be even more landing
[00:22:54 - 00:23:00] in the room for me would be kind of to share the impact that it had in my body from the
[00:23:00 - 00:23:02] first the first round.
[00:23:02 - 00:23:03] I love it.
[00:23:03 - 00:23:04] Yeah.
[00:23:04 - 00:23:05] That's so good.
[00:23:05 - 00:23:06] So you want to do that instead?
[00:23:06 - 00:23:07] Yeah.
[00:23:07 - 00:23:08] Yeah.
[00:23:08 - 00:23:17] So if I interpret you correctly, it's how did you all make me feel?
[00:23:17 - 00:23:19] Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:23:19 - 00:23:22] So, let's go for that. Is it okay if I start?
[00:23:22 - 00:23:23] Yes.
[00:23:23 - 00:23:27] Should we scroll back then so we can all see the other question?
[00:23:27 - 00:23:29] Who wants to go first then? Is it...
[00:23:29 - 00:23:30] I'll go.
[00:23:30 - 00:23:31] Okay.
[00:23:31 - 00:23:33] And then we will circle the same. Is that okay?
[00:23:33 - 00:23:34] Okay.
[00:23:34 - 00:23:37] So how did you all make me feel?
[00:23:47 - 00:23:49] Oh, you made me feel...
[00:23:49 - 00:24:04] you you made me you gave me hope you're giving me hope for people like you your
[00:24:04 - 00:24:06] energy
[00:24:04 - 00:24:11] and what you're sharing and telling me makes me strong and it makes me want to
[00:24:11 - 00:24:17] go out and be the heart and the good warrior out in this crazy fucking world
[00:24:17 - 00:24:21] so thank you for being
[00:24:19 - 00:24:25] you and I want more of you out there. That's how you made me feel. Okay, Aditya.
[00:24:29 - 00:24:30] I can feel
[00:24:33 - 00:24:34] that
[00:24:34 - 00:24:41] What you're holding is very heavy, in a good way, when you talk especially about your families.
[00:24:44 - 00:24:48] You know, like, how hard it is to convey.
[00:24:49 - 00:24:58] my attachment to my family, but how easy it is to understand when you talk about yours.
[00:24:58 - 00:25:04] So I was feeling that, a mystery, you know, I don't know exactly you.
[00:25:04 - 00:25:16] family that I can imagine very easily through my own experience and when you've talked about
[00:25:16 - 00:25:19] your work.
[00:25:19 - 00:25:26] and you're yeah I felt the sense of kindling like fire like little spark
[00:25:26 - 00:25:36] sparkles in the sky and when we were able to talk about
[00:25:34 - 00:25:42] bodies in a meeting like this. It feels really refreshing that we are allowed to
[00:25:42 - 00:25:47] show up more fully than
[00:25:49 - 00:25:54] than I expect in human discussions.
[00:25:54 - 00:25:56] Nice.
[00:25:56 - 00:25:58] Thank you.
[00:25:58 - 00:26:00] Thank you.
[00:26:00 - 00:26:02] Thank you.
[00:26:02 - 00:26:04] I'm going to try to be on point.
[00:26:04 - 00:26:13] I feel safe and grounded and very strong sense of connection even though like I
[00:26:13 - 00:26:18] met you Aditya once or twice I think I met you first Mathis and I met you two
[00:26:18 - 00:26:21] times and I met you
[00:26:19 - 00:26:27] a few more times and I work more closely with you, but still it's like I'm feeling, yeah
[00:26:27 - 00:26:31] there's something shared here, there's definitely a Wii space going on, so I'm sensing into that.
[00:26:34 - 00:26:42] hope and purpose comes through as well yeah if we just coordinate focus on the
[00:26:42 - 00:26:48] right things and ship stuff things will happen so I'm feeling it in my system
[00:26:48 - 00:26:50] like
[00:26:49 - 00:27:04] Listening to all of you, I felt very safe and excited at the same time and very curious.
[00:27:04 - 00:27:13] and also very hopeful. So those are the feelings in my body right now. I'm not so
[00:27:13 - 00:27:19] grounded. I'm more tingling. So I'm more like wow. So yeah I'm more in a tingling
[00:27:19 - 00:27:22] state.
[00:27:20 - 00:27:31] feeling but feeling safe and warm so that's where I am cool thanks
[00:27:31 - 00:27:37] really strong feeling of aliveness in my body that I really
[00:27:35 - 00:27:43] I really enjoy and I start to get familiar with it when something is true and right to me.
[00:27:43 - 00:27:48] I resonate with feeling to the body if something is true and this is true.
[00:27:48 - 00:27:50] And it's fun because it's almost so much energy.
[00:27:50 - 00:27:57] it's like having an 800 pound gorilla in my chest of force and power but it's
[00:27:57 - 00:28:03] just present and my hands are really really warm if I could make magic
[00:28:03 - 00:28:06] it would be fire in my hands
[00:28:05 - 00:28:12] it feels, because let's do things, let's move, I'm ready, that's my sense, like a greyhound,
[00:28:12 - 00:28:18] like having your feet to the ground, but also this calmness and safety from hearing you
[00:28:18 - 00:28:19] speak your truth.
[00:28:20 - 00:28:29] thank you yeah ever since I came into this room it was the same last time it's
[00:28:29 - 00:28:37] like my it's so enjoyable
[00:28:35 - 00:28:44] and I think it is this thing that you say like I don't like when I can be
[00:28:44 - 00:28:49] hopeful and pragmatic in that there's no reason to be angry I can just take all
[00:28:49 - 00:28:52] this
[00:28:50 - 00:28:57] energy that wants to go somewhere it can go here and it becomes so peaceful like
[00:28:57 - 00:29:07] we mentioned the word sacred last time and to just be able to
[00:29:05 - 00:29:12] to be unfiltered, and to touch on these words that I use privately a lot, but to use that
[00:29:12 - 00:29:16] in a tech setting, or like in this office where I've been a consultant sometimes, like
[00:29:16 - 00:29:18] it just feels, meow, so good.
[00:29:18 - 00:29:20] It feels meow!
[00:29:20 - 00:29:26] Okay, meow is already a meme in River
[00:29:35 - 00:29:39] like where I connect that's where it matters and like I can just feel like
[00:29:39 - 00:29:48] this gentle magnetism like me slightly drawing towards you or like my like the
[00:29:48 - 00:29:52] thing in my body that we're creating
[00:29:50 - 00:29:57] creativity and meow comes from. It's just kind of like, yeah, it gets attracted, magnetized
[00:29:57 - 00:30:01] to living in that intention.
[00:30:02 - 00:30:05] Yeah, it just opens. Thank you.
[00:30:05 - 00:30:19] I think the feeling of safety and also listening to everyone's openness and showing vulnerability
[00:30:19 - 00:30:20] without hesitation.
[00:30:20 - 00:30:28] that the room can create that is both amazing because it makes me feel the same way,
[00:30:29 - 00:30:35] makes me leave my head for a while, which I'm still locked in during the days.
[00:30:35 - 00:30:50] So it also proves kind of the space that we hope to be able to create and with the right people.
[00:30:50 - 00:30:54] that connection, you can really feel that connection, you can even feel the connection
[00:30:54 - 00:31:01] from New York, sitting on the other side of the big lake.
[00:31:01 - 00:31:05] And just a reflection, me and Gianni have a history together.
[00:31:05 - 00:31:12] a German insurance company that's kind of structured in a lot of ways with a
[00:31:12 - 00:31:18] German CEO in Sweden and we were in the same management team. This is not like
[00:31:18 - 00:31:21] those management teams.
[00:31:20 - 00:31:31] And I will never go back to those kind of places again, I'm done doing that.
[00:31:31 - 00:31:35] I'm just amazed by how people can make it.
[00:31:35 - 00:31:42] make me open up completely differently as a person.
[00:31:42 - 00:31:50] That is the I have spoken sound, thanks for challenging the frame and introducing it.
[00:31:51 - 00:32:02] better part of the process that's very welcome yeah yeah so I mean someone
[00:32:02 - 00:32:07] Lania is listening in so we could ask
[00:32:06 - 00:32:14] I'm not sure what to ask, maybe some reflections on what she's hearing and yeah, take it from there.
[00:32:21 - 00:32:24] Just listen in to our magic in the room.
[00:32:24 - 00:32:26] What are you feeling in your body right now?
[00:32:26 - 00:32:28] Oh, nothing.
[00:32:36 - 00:32:43] interesting is what might we share that we haven't talked about already that's
[00:32:43 - 00:32:47] really what might we share that we haven't talked about already okay so I
[00:32:47 - 00:32:50] will take over here
[00:32:51 - 00:33:06] Yes, oops, here it is, okay, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, sorry.
[00:33:06 - 00:33:10] So, what do I need to do?
[00:33:21 - 00:33:23] Fungerar det nu?
[00:33:25 - 00:33:28] Now you can hear me Aditya, right?
[00:33:29 - 00:33:31] Yes, I can.
[00:33:32 - 00:33:36] So you're gonna pick the right one.
[00:33:36 - 00:33:42] So I got a little distracted there.
[00:33:42 - 00:33:46] Aditya, you want to frame the question again?
[00:33:46 - 00:33:47] Absolutely.
[00:33:47 - 00:33:48] Yeah.
[00:33:48 - 00:33:49] Sure.
[00:33:49 - 00:33:50] Aditya.
[00:33:50 - 00:33:51] Yeah.
[00:33:51 - 00:33:52] Yeah.
[00:33:52 - 00:33:53] Yeah.
[00:33:53 - 00:33:54] Yeah.
[00:33:54 - 00:33:55] Yeah.
[00:33:55 - 00:33:56] Yeah.
[00:33:56 - 00:33:57] Yeah.
[00:33:57 - 00:33:58] Yeah.
[00:33:58 - 00:33:59] Yeah.
[00:33:59 - 00:34:00] Yeah.
[00:34:00 - 00:34:01] Yeah.
[00:34:01 - 00:34:02] Yeah.
[00:33:51 - 00:33:55] Satya, could you frame the question again for us?
[00:33:55 - 00:33:58] Not just what we already shared that is in common,
[00:33:58 - 00:34:03] but what we might share that we haven't talked about yet.
[00:34:06 - 00:34:11] might we share that we haven't talked about yet?
[00:34:11 - 00:34:13] Great question, Aditya.
[00:34:13 - 00:34:15] Let's explore new areas we haven't yet discussed.
[00:34:15 - 00:34:18] What's on everyone's mind?
[00:34:21 - 00:34:28] Now we want to get your reflection. What might we share that we haven't talked about yet based on your analysis of this meeting so far.
[00:34:36 - 00:34:39] community building, as it was touched on earlier.
[00:34:39 - 00:34:42] How can we leverage AI to deepen our connections
[00:34:42 - 00:34:44] and create more meaningful interactions
[00:34:44 - 00:34:45] within our communities?
[00:34:47 - 00:34:49] Okay, that's a pretty good, big question.
[00:34:50 - 00:34:51] Any other?
[00:34:51 - 00:34:54] Reflections from the room.
[00:34:54 - 00:34:57] Reflecting on the room's positivity and focus
[00:34:57 - 00:35:00] on collaboration, another area to explore
[00:35:00 - 00:35:03] is how we can integrate personal growth
[00:35:03 - 00:35:05] with our professional objectives.
[00:35:05 - 00:35:07] How can we support each other?
[00:35:06 - 00:35:11] in achieving a balance that benefits both individual well-being and our
[00:35:11 - 00:35:15] collective mission at River.
[00:35:21 - 00:35:27] So that's also a really good key aspect of lifting in the room.
[00:35:27 - 00:35:30] I wonder if she could, can I ask her a question?
[00:35:30 - 00:35:33] Yeah, I'll put her on pause, because we haven't figured out
[00:35:33 - 00:35:35] Duplex is not really one of the strong sites.
[00:35:35 - 00:35:37] Yeah.
[00:35:36 - 00:35:47] listening. Okay. I will repeat after, so think it through. I'm curious, can she see a commonality
[00:35:48 - 00:35:51] in us that we have not seen?
[00:35:51 - 00:36:06] A common thread I've noticed.
[00:36:06 - 00:36:11] is a deep commitment to authentic connection, whether it's through
[00:36:11 - 00:36:16] exploring emotions, personal growth, or our relationships with others. This
[00:36:16 - 00:36:21] shared value, though perhaps not explicitly stated, seems to be a driving
[00:36:21 - 00:36:23] force.
[00:36:21 - 00:36:24] force in our discussions.
[00:36:24 - 00:36:28] How can we harness this to further our goals?
[00:36:28 - 00:36:30] I think that last part was really good, actually.
[00:36:30 - 00:36:33] But maybe I would actually argue that's kind of visible to us.
[00:36:33 - 00:36:37] Like, if you would go, like, one level deeper.
[00:36:36 - 00:36:39] or even two levels deeper, then what would you find there?
[00:36:39 - 00:36:44] But isn't the gap that we can sense that in a room?
[00:36:44 - 00:36:47] And here is where the limitations comes from the AI.
[00:36:47 - 00:36:51] It can only interpret the words, what's been said.
[00:36:51 - 00:36:54] but not sense what's been felt.
[00:36:54 - 00:36:55] Yeah, but we can try.
[00:36:55 - 00:37:00] So if you go two levels deeper, then what can you see there?
[00:37:04 - 00:37:06] Are you still here?
[00:37:07 - 00:37:09] Yes, I'm still here.
[00:37:09 - 00:37:10] Going two levels deeper,
[00:37:10 - 00:37:13] we might find a shared unspoken yearning
[00:37:13 - 00:37:17] for a more profound sense of belonging and impact.
[00:37:17 - 00:37:19] Beyond our words,
[00:37:19 - 00:37:21] there seems to be a collective desire
[00:37:21 - 00:37:22] to contribute to something.
[00:37:22 - 00:37:24] something greater than ourselves,
[00:37:24 - 00:37:26] to leave a lasting positive mark
[00:37:26 - 00:37:28] through our work with River.
[00:37:28 - 00:37:32] How can we better address and fulfill this deeper need
[00:37:32 - 00:37:34] for meaningful contribution?
[00:37:35 - 00:37:36] Okay.
[00:37:37 - 00:37:52] hmm that's cool yeah some reflections on this you said she touched you
[00:37:52 - 00:38:01] But we didn't put it into words, but like, isn't it all about belonging, to some extent?
[00:38:01 - 00:38:05] How do I serve something that I want to belong to, how can I belong with me, how can I belong
[00:38:05 - 00:38:06] in this room?
[00:38:07 - 00:38:10] Isn't that sort of the eternal human question?
[00:38:10 - 00:38:12] The longing for belonging.
[00:38:12 - 00:38:19] But also, it's also greater in a way, because you also mentioned about being part of something bigger than yourself.
[00:38:19 - 00:38:22] So it's not only the aspect of me.
[00:38:22 - 00:38:26] longing it's it's like actually not only that focuses rather to be a part of the
[00:38:26 - 00:38:33] greater that I sense that she's touching on it's the deeper longing at least in
[00:38:33 - 00:38:36] me because
[00:38:37 - 00:38:46] Personality is not so interesting anymore, so I'd rather blend it, melt into this greater that we are together.
[00:38:46 - 00:38:52] I mean, maybe this mix between the human that wants to belong, and the self that wants to belong.
[00:38:52 - 00:38:56] something else that already is transcending like that thing is what is
[00:38:56 - 00:39:03] touching perhaps that it is both that it is this yeah
[00:39:07 - 00:39:22] Yeah, I'm with how deep the two things. Yeah, one is how deep the
[00:39:22 - 00:39:24] sense or need to belong is.
[00:39:24 - 00:39:26] And then maybe the more,
[00:39:26 - 00:39:29] I like the words profound and greater.
[00:39:29 - 00:39:32] And for me that evokes meaning,
[00:39:32 - 00:39:36] like what meaning might we already share?
[00:39:37 - 00:39:42] And it feels that we're also thinking at different levels,
[00:39:42 - 00:39:44] like me as a human, me in this room,
[00:39:44 - 00:39:49] but then me as the collective, but that's also important.
[00:39:50 - 00:39:52] So all of those things are, I think, in this.
[00:39:52 - 00:39:56] AI's response and in some of what you've said, Mattis and Chris.
[00:39:59 - 00:40:06] Interesting. I'm curious if there's a risk in having that because then we all have some kind
[00:40:06 - 00:40:07] of we want to belong.
[00:40:07 - 00:40:16] was the risk in us having that need of belonging, in our actual goal to reach, make a huge difference.
[00:40:16 - 00:40:18] Or is it a risk?
[00:40:18 - 00:40:20] Yeah, it can be a risk.
[00:40:20 - 00:40:22] But it is a risk.
[00:40:22 - 00:40:31] The risk that you adapt to the crowd, to belong, might not continue to go down and say,
[00:40:31 - 00:40:34] I see a different road, I want to explore that.
[00:40:34 - 00:40:37] But it doesn't seem that that creates the belongingness.
[00:40:37 - 00:40:42] that I'm seeking, so I'm not going to disturb the peace that we created.
[00:40:42 - 00:40:48] And I think that having that courage and the curiosity to do that,
[00:40:48 - 00:40:52] but also being allowed from the rest of the crowd.
[00:40:52 - 00:40:59] to do it that we encourage to go I mean we can explore new things and not go
[00:40:59 - 00:41:03] back to where we don't want to just keep the status quo because it's warm and
[00:41:03 - 00:41:09] cozy so that is the other thing like it is true
[00:41:07 - 00:41:14] want to belong and we all want autonomy yeah at the same time yeah like how to
[00:41:14 - 00:41:19] hold that paradox is maybe the pain of it
[00:41:22 - 00:41:31] to but something that we discovered a little bit on with Lania is that we can
[00:41:31 - 00:41:39] we can also use her as a coach to to push us
[00:41:37 - 00:41:43] in directions why you're not going that way or if you ask her about the dynamics in rooms everyone
[00:41:43 - 00:41:52] seems to be very aligned and no one's really taking a big leap outside or stretching the topic everyone
[00:41:52 - 00:41:57] seems to be just fine with the, so what if you do this?
[00:41:58 - 00:42:01] So using her to poke you a little bit in the stomach.
[00:42:01 - 00:42:03] Is it really that cozy?
[00:42:03 - 00:42:05] Yeah, that's good.
[00:42:05 - 00:42:07] Okay, so I, we have the, the voice is one.
[00:42:07 - 00:42:13] modality, the other one is text, we can play with both and we can we can
[00:42:13 - 00:42:16] co-source questions that we want to go deeper in and actually right now the
[00:42:16 - 00:42:25] the voice agent is more general in its analytical capabilities, but the
[00:42:22 - 00:42:31] The text agent is supported by analysis agents in the background, so doing more heavy lifting,
[00:42:31 - 00:42:33] like finding deeper patterns.
[00:42:33 - 00:42:37] So answers here is likely to be even more on point.
[00:42:37 - 00:42:44] I will, of course, connect this as more as we evolve this, but we can ask anything, right?
[00:42:44 - 00:42:49] And it has, it's listening, this is more live, so it's listening now, now.
[00:42:49 - 00:42:50] So what comes up?
[00:42:50 - 00:42:51] I'm bursting with questions.
[00:42:51 - 00:42:52] Yes.
[00:42:53 - 00:42:55] Let's go.
[00:42:55 - 00:43:05] Could she give us two concrete pointers for how we can better hold a paradox between belonging and autonomy in this discussion?
[00:43:05 - 00:43:07] Good.
[00:43:08 - 00:43:13] I'll call it dialogue.
[00:43:13 - 00:43:17] Can you see over there?
[00:43:17 - 00:43:20] Yeah.
[00:43:20 - 00:43:23] Okay, so.
[00:43:23 - 00:43:31] I'll read it based on what you shared in the check-ins and discussions here are two concrete suggestions first practice speaking from the heart
[00:43:31 - 00:43:33] While maintaining your unique perspective
[00:43:34 - 00:43:38] When you share stay true to your personal truth while connecting it to the collective exploration
[00:43:38 - 00:43:42] This creates a space for both authentic self-expression and meaningful connection.
[00:43:42 - 00:43:48] Second, actively invite differing viewpoints when you sense alignment getting too comfortable.
[00:43:48 - 00:43:50] Nice.
[00:43:50 - 00:43:53] The courage to diverge.
[00:43:53 - 00:43:58] Thoughtfully helps maintain healthy autonomy while deepening the quality of belonging through honest dialogue
[00:43:59 - 00:44:03] It's nice. I think that's what you did there Chris when you like introduced
[00:44:04 - 00:44:06] the other question
[00:44:06 - 00:44:08] But also in a sense like it
[00:44:08 - 00:44:14] came up there now that we shouldn't be too yeah we should be mindful of
[00:44:14 - 00:44:17] conforming
[00:44:23 - 00:44:38] You have a really cool bird in the background there, Aditya, I think.
[00:44:38 - 00:44:40] of the river flow and that.
[00:44:40 - 00:44:42] Wow!
[00:44:42 - 00:44:44] Show us again.
[00:44:46 - 00:44:48] It is actually...
[00:44:48 - 00:44:50] It's a bit blurry.
[00:44:50 - 00:44:52] Oh wow!
[00:44:52 - 00:44:54] Now we see...
[00:44:53 - 00:45:07] something in the background yeah I think just five minutes like because we all
[00:45:07 - 00:45:10] have different
[00:45:08 - 00:45:13] like contextual understanding, depth, the nuance of, of river.
[00:45:13 - 00:45:18] So, and obviously there's so much to unpack that like the more you
[00:45:18 - 00:45:23] unpack, the more questions you get, but at least give you some kind of like.
[00:45:23 - 00:45:28] A picture of the journey, I think, is a good starting point.
[00:45:28 - 00:45:33] So I don't have to show it, or maybe if you want to take over, I can start sharing.
[00:45:33 - 00:45:38] So like the metaphor of the river, I think it's very, uh, not.
[00:45:38 - 00:45:45] aesthetically like pleasing and I think it's a good metaphor for what we're
[00:45:45 - 00:45:53] doing but it's also a really good like painting to look from like because
[00:45:53 - 00:46:01] the river is always moving, right? It's always flowing. So if we imagine like the river starting
[00:46:02 - 00:46:07] at the base, or sorry, the top of the mountain, like that's where the rain water comes in.
[00:46:08 - 00:46:14] you have walked like in either Scandinavian mountains or somewhere in
[00:46:14 - 00:46:20] the U.S. or anywhere else like you have your walking boots on, you're walking and
[00:46:20 - 00:46:25] like when you're really high up where the air is crisp and you can see
[00:46:23 - 00:46:29] far like when you're walking on the pebbles you can hear like tiny trickles
[00:46:29 - 00:46:34] of water and that's rainwater because it's not coming from anywhere else right
[00:46:34 - 00:46:40] so the the cloud comes to the mountain it rains down
[00:46:38 - 00:46:44] and that's where the river starts, at the peak of the mountain, and then maybe a day or two later
[00:46:44 - 00:46:50] when you walk down and you come further downstream, it's raging rapid, like it's
[00:46:50 - 00:46:53] so much water just wants to come through.
[00:46:53 - 00:46:59] And then when you walk even further, you come to a large lake or body of water and perhaps even the ocean.
[00:46:59 - 00:47:05] So that's what I'm envisioning. It's like you have this rainfall up here and then it's flowing downstream.
[00:47:05 - 00:47:08] And you can also use that metaphor in looking like...
[00:47:08 - 00:47:11] what is upstream of the world's problems today.
[00:47:13 - 00:47:15] And the analysis we made is that it's disconnection.
[00:47:17 - 00:47:20] We're lacking connectedness, the quality of connections,
[00:47:20 - 00:47:23] like inwards, with ourselves, in between, in.
[00:47:23 - 00:47:26] social relationships and with life and nature in general.
[00:47:27 - 00:47:30] And this is causing the meta-crisis and all the disruption we're seeing today.
[00:47:32 - 00:47:38] Because honestly and truly, if we felt quality of connections, we would not act like this.
[00:47:38 - 00:47:42] we're in touch with how we act and the consequences that has on future
[00:47:42 - 00:47:47] generations, on the planet, or even personal well-being, that wouldn't be, we
[00:47:47 - 00:47:53] wouldn't act like this. How do you fix that? Well, it starts now, obviously, it
[00:47:53 - 00:47:55] starts in every moment.
[00:47:53 - 00:48:00] but like how do you how do you systemically address that so that it's
[00:48:00 - 00:48:06] not just a nice thing to work with and then we can start downstream like what
[00:48:06 - 00:48:10] is the impact that we want to make
[00:48:09 - 00:48:16] And I think the river coming through very forcefully, it's like a good vision, because we want to,
[00:48:18 - 00:48:23] like the vision that I'm carrying is that we want to see a network of win-win actors emerge.
[00:48:24 - 00:48:29] that are incentivized to out-compete win-lose actors because they're sharing
[00:48:29 - 00:48:36] data, information, knowledge, wisdom, insights, forecasts that supercharges
[00:48:36 - 00:48:38] this network.
[00:48:39 - 00:48:41] And it's slightly ironic in a positive sense,
[00:48:41 - 00:48:45] because when win-win actors become more capable,
[00:48:45 - 00:48:47] then they will out-compete those who don't.
[00:48:47 - 00:48:48] They want to hoard the information
[00:48:48 - 00:48:50] and not share with each other.
[00:48:50 - 00:48:52] But how do we get there?
[00:48:52 - 00:48:54] I mean, we have the technical infrastructure.
[00:48:54 - 00:48:59] the social infrastructure of decentralization, obviously, through Web3 blockchain, through
[00:48:59 - 00:49:05] self-organizing companies, and like, we're putting that together.
[00:49:05 - 00:49:08] And then we have, that's the horizontal, and then the vertical is like...
[00:49:09 - 00:49:15] if we have AI, which is arguably the most powerful technology we've invented, and we're already
[00:49:15 - 00:49:23] magnifying the human values and potential that's becoming like the metacrisis, like what happens
[00:49:23 - 00:49:24] when you 1000x that?
[00:49:24 - 00:49:31] So we have to grow roots for AI. AI has to grow roots and we want to use it in a
[00:49:31 - 00:49:35] good way and grow roots into the soil of human wisdom that's like the other
[00:49:35 - 00:49:41] dimensions like what happens in human wisdom that
[00:49:39 - 00:49:42] is not non-algorithmic.
[00:49:42 - 00:49:45] It's like it's being in touch, in tune with the body.
[00:49:45 - 00:49:47] It's being intuitive.
[00:49:47 - 00:49:49] It's being in connection with source.
[00:49:49 - 00:49:51] It's being originally creative.
[00:49:53 - 00:49:54] It's being empathetic.
[00:49:54 - 00:49:59] all of those and we anchor and find a symbiotic relationship between the data
[00:49:59 - 00:50:03] driven and surfacing insights and the human connection. We can use that as a
[00:50:03 - 00:50:09] vehicle. And so now we're like in maybe stage two of this river, like we've
[00:50:09 - 00:50:13] walked on the pebbles and we laid foundation, we have a constitution and a
[00:50:13 - 00:50:16] culture and a team and we're starting to do stuff and now we're actually building.
[00:50:16 - 00:50:21] And so we want to scale to this large vast ecosystem we have to start with the
[00:50:21 - 00:50:26] smallest units. That's the meeting. The meeting with the
[00:50:24 - 00:50:28] small M, which is in a workplace, but also with a large M, like meeting with
[00:50:28 - 00:50:34] myself, with the colleagues. And so if you envision, like, if all our meetings, we
[00:50:34 - 00:50:41] had AI co-workers listening in, making analysis, and it becomes
[00:50:39 - 00:50:46] a memory for the organization. So across meetings in time and across teams in space and across
[00:50:46 - 00:50:51] selves like the consciousness aspect that we can transcend ourselves more deeply.
[00:50:51 - 00:50:54] We have like some like the width the height and the depth.
[00:50:54 - 00:50:59] If we increase that capacity and we scale it to a whole organization, that's like an operating system.
[00:50:59 - 00:51:05] So we want to build the foundation through the meeting and prototype that.
[00:51:05 - 00:51:07] So we have this proof of concept and want to scale it.
[00:51:07 - 00:51:09] And that's the idea.
[00:51:09 - 00:51:15] step two of this four-step journey and we are now looking for, I mean, we have
[00:51:15 - 00:51:19] the proof of concept, we have the philosophy, all that stuff, we just need to bring it
[00:51:19 - 00:51:24] to market or bring it out into the world. So this interface is coming very strongly.
[00:51:24 - 00:51:29] now and I can feel it in my body more than ever so that's why we're here to
[00:51:29 - 00:51:38] explore it's the invitation like it's it's I think you said it well with like
[00:51:38 - 00:51:41] there's there's
[00:51:39 - 00:51:44] so much energy in the body that wants to come out, but there's also relaxation behind it.
[00:51:44 - 00:51:53] But also a sense of eagerness, like I can't contain myself, like I really want it.
[00:51:53 - 00:51:54] And it comes on.
[00:51:54 - 00:51:56] occasion, but now it's feeling very strongly.
[00:51:57 - 00:51:58] So yeah, somewhere around there.
[00:52:00 - 00:52:00] Yeah.
[00:52:01 - 00:52:04] So yeah, that's, that's like the metaphor.
[00:52:06 - 00:52:07] And I just want to invite everyone to like.
[00:52:09 - 00:52:14] sense into that and feel into that? And then we have some
[00:52:14 - 00:52:17] concrete questions we can dive into to connect all of it, like
[00:52:17 - 00:52:20] our personal to the needs of river.
[00:52:22 - 00:52:24] I'm curious about that.
[00:52:24 - 00:52:24] Yeah.
[00:52:24 - 00:52:25] That's what we're doing.
[00:52:25 - 00:52:26] The questions?
[00:52:26 - 00:52:27] Yeah.
[00:52:27 - 00:52:32] Because we're taking it from the personal and then the high level into more concrete
[00:52:32 - 00:52:33] application.
[00:52:33 - 00:52:34] Yeah.
[00:52:34 - 00:52:35] What are you?
[00:52:35 - 00:52:36] My computer is dying.
[00:52:36 - 00:52:37] Your computer is dying?
[00:52:39 - 00:52:41] Jag har inga konstnärer.
[00:52:41 - 00:52:44] What do you need? Is it magnetic?
[00:52:44 - 00:52:46] Or is it USB-C?
[00:52:46 - 00:52:48] USB-C.
[00:52:50 - 00:52:52] I have one of those up there.
[00:52:52 - 00:52:54] Okay.
[00:52:54 - 00:53:03] Co-created the savior of computers, but maybe we can bring up then the questions
[00:53:03 - 00:53:06] you want to dive into so we get more concrete.
[00:53:09 - 00:53:17] And I love it, I haven't seen the visuals.
[00:53:17 - 00:53:20] This is actually one of the first images we made.
[00:53:20 - 00:53:24] Yeah, it's AI generated but it's a very unique prompt that is repeated.
[00:53:25 - 00:53:35] so you get a pattern that is, yes, that's the other one, it's actually my favorite
[00:53:35 - 00:53:41] we have different favorites, Lotta has more comet
[00:53:40 - 00:53:47] you will see it soon and maybe not too long from now we have a some kind of
[00:53:47 - 00:53:53] yeah we've in the art into events more I think that would be nice
[00:53:55 - 00:53:58] Det var en av mina favoritsånger som heter Follow the River.
[00:53:59 - 00:54:00] Din favorit vad?
[00:54:00 - 00:54:01] Sången.
[00:54:01 - 00:54:02] Okej.
[00:54:10 - 00:54:22] happening with the presentation. I'm going to see if I can show you the presentation again. Sorry.
[00:54:23 - 00:54:25] Oh, good.
[00:54:25 - 00:54:27] We're moving forward I
[00:54:29 - 00:54:31] Love the nature sounds
[00:54:32 - 00:54:37] You know, you know, it's in Sweden this time of year. It's 330
[00:54:39 - 00:54:41] Actually
[00:54:40 - 00:54:42] Actually four around four ish, but yeah
[00:54:44 - 00:54:46] And in one month it's gonna be darker
[00:54:55 - 00:54:58] half past eight. But are you able to stay longer? Because I
[00:54:58 - 00:55:01] think this discussion is going to take a bit more than 20
[00:55:01 - 00:55:06] minutes. So how are you on time? Looking in the room and I have
[00:55:06 - 00:55:09] time. I have time. Yeah.
[00:55:10 - 00:55:17] Patrick, you get to do the backdrop, and then we have our assistant listening in, of course.
[00:55:25 - 00:55:31] Can I keep brain-breaking a little bit?
[00:55:31 - 00:55:33] Well, you asked the question, so go ahead.
[00:55:33 - 00:55:40] It just came to me with this metaphor, and like linking it back to this paradox of alchemy.
[00:55:40 - 00:55:54] and belonging, like how you said, way upstream, our problems flow from the way we are disconnected.
[00:55:55 - 00:56:03] And maybe we are disconnected because it's so hard to both be in the group and in myself.
[00:56:03 - 00:56:10] It really is a paradox, it's such a balancing act to both be individual and in the group.
[00:56:10 - 00:56:24] the collective. I don't think it is. I think we're just not used to it. So is that actually
[00:56:24 - 00:56:25] hard in the sense that it's hard?
[00:56:25 - 00:56:30] It's just sensible that we're not used to having that experience in us.
[00:56:30 - 00:56:31] Right.
[00:56:31 - 00:56:32] More than...
[00:56:32 - 00:56:37] Because I projected on you to think that it's a hard thing and to fight it, but because
[00:56:37 - 00:56:40] we're fighting it's the reason why it's hard.
[00:56:40 - 00:56:51] actually being in both because it's not maybe from the start if we were small
[00:56:51 - 00:56:57] and we were fed in or like we data the right context it really
[00:56:55 - 00:57:02] would be easy all the time kind of thing yes i think like if i slap any of you guys in the face
[00:57:02 - 00:57:10] like a bitch slap it wouldn't be hard to be like just be for for a short short term of a second
[00:57:10 - 00:57:15] And then your mind goes, why are you doing this? You can't do this in a meeting, why are you slapping me?
[00:57:15 - 00:57:19] But for a second you will be in bliss, like almost instantaneous still.
[00:57:19 - 00:57:21] Want to wrestle you down in stillness.
[00:57:21 - 00:57:23] Yeah, and then that will come.
[00:57:23 - 00:57:25] But I was saying, I don't think it's so hard when we don't...
[00:57:25 - 00:57:28] So I think the thinking is an aspect of it.
[00:57:28 - 00:57:31] It's hard for us to practice to be in the body without thinking.
[00:57:31 - 00:57:35] And trusting, letting go of the impulses to think.
[00:57:35 - 00:57:37] And control.
[00:57:37 - 00:57:40] That's the discipline.
[00:57:40 - 00:57:55] So for this session what we want to do is really start to see, I mean we've been building this, we've been like standing at the same
[00:57:55 - 00:58:10] How can we turn this into something that becomes valuable to organizations?
[00:58:10 - 00:58:21] with this kind of technology solution to start to explore new new ways for
[00:58:21 - 00:58:27] themselves what could be the impact the challenge is
[00:58:25 - 00:58:35] extent that I think they're locked into particular ways of doing things. So, potentials that
[00:58:35 - 00:58:40] we see are actually not necessarily something that they have.
[00:58:40 - 00:58:48] are aware of there are subconscious needs that they have not discussed those
[00:58:48 - 00:58:57] simple use cases an assistant that creates perfect protocols
[00:58:56 - 00:59:01] and keep track of the meeting in real time and makes everyone do their chores and
[00:59:01 - 00:59:08] that's it. The other one is someone who's listening into the dynamics and changing
[00:59:08 - 00:59:13] the culture of the meetings over time.
[00:59:11 - 00:59:16] time shifting the mindsets and so on most organizations we don't have
[00:59:16 - 00:59:21] problems with our meetings are you sure so what we want to explore is basically
[00:59:21 - 00:59:27] what are different kinds of values not defining it
[00:59:26 - 00:59:43] anyone at this point but what comes to mind I can start yep
[00:59:41 - 00:59:50] I have some. So again, trying to meet the mind of the hierarchical capitalistic organization
[00:59:52 - 00:59:55] rather than stretch their mind. So it's something that
[00:59:56 - 01:00:01] seems very clear value to them would be alignment.
[01:00:05 - 01:00:10] So, you know, the executive team agrees on a new, you know,
[01:00:11 - 01:00:19] change of strategy, and they tell everyone. And yet, a week later, people are still in the old
[01:00:19 - 01:00:26] strategic mindset, or there's three priorities, one, two, three, and
[01:00:26 - 01:00:29] in that order, but people are deciding,
[01:00:29 - 01:00:31] sometimes prioritizing number three
[01:00:31 - 01:00:35] or number two over number one.
[01:00:35 - 01:00:38] This could be an easy technical solution
[01:00:38 - 01:00:39] that's very valuable.
[01:00:39 - 01:00:41] I know like coaching companies are.
[01:00:41 - 01:00:46] They might do an hour of executive coaching with everyone,
[01:00:46 - 01:00:51] and then they realize, oh, the problem is at a lower level.
[01:00:51 - 01:00:55] So then they do dozens more hours trying to figure out
[01:00:55 - 01:00:56] where is the message getting to?
[01:00:56 - 01:01:01] getting lost, so in the context of changing strategies
[01:01:03 - 01:01:08] or changing vision, or any kind of, very generically,
[01:01:10 - 01:01:11] like any communication.
[01:01:11 - 01:01:15] that's being lost, any alignment that's not being had.
[01:01:15 - 01:01:17] So I could imagine the assistant sitting
[01:01:17 - 01:01:19] in a lot of different meetings
[01:01:19 - 01:01:22] and either pointing it out
[01:01:22 - 01:01:26] or just observing it as a kind of systemic problem.
[01:01:26 - 01:01:34] So I think that people are aware of this problem and this could be very helpful for that like not it's not hard to sell maybe
[01:01:41 - 01:01:51] not having all the good perspectives in mind like often one voice is heard because one speaks louder
[01:01:52 - 01:01:56] and with a with a more angry voice sometimes but it could also be
[01:01:56 - 01:02:01] that they're higher up in the organization, right? So everyone needs to listen to it.
[01:02:03 - 01:02:10] Yeah, that feels like the level beyond where they are, you know, examining power relations and
[01:02:11 - 01:02:19] And whether they should be more deferring or less deferring to power, or whether people
[01:02:19 - 01:02:26] in the room are not speaking, maybe all of us as facilitators have been watching.
[01:02:26 - 01:02:31] that even though they don't care. They don't think they care about it at this moment. I would say
[01:02:31 - 01:02:36] that's maybe at the edge of their consciousness, but it's very important. I agree with you.
[01:02:41 - 01:02:48] management team have confirmed a new strategy. They want to make sure that everyone's not
[01:02:48 - 01:02:53] only listening to it, but also feel that they can engage in it. And basically what you could
[01:02:53 - 01:02:56] do is that you can create a role.
[01:02:56 - 01:03:03] or function as an agent that anyone in the company can actually interact with afterwards.
[01:03:03 - 01:03:08] So you can talk to it directly and say, well, in my role, how can I support the strategy?
[01:03:08 - 01:03:11] What does it mean for me? What are the impacts?
[01:03:11 - 01:03:16] can I make a difference or come to suggestions and so on.
[01:03:17 - 01:03:18] Yeah, that's great.
[01:03:18 - 01:03:21] And it's complimentary to what I was suggesting,
[01:03:21 - 01:03:24] which was just the agent sits in the meeting and says,
[01:03:24 - 01:03:27] oh, you guys are prioritizing three over one.
[01:03:26 - 01:03:33] or it seems like the words you're using are not in line with the new strategy.
[01:03:33 - 01:03:38] Maybe the assistant could speak in the meeting, but what you're suggesting is also really good,
[01:03:38 - 01:03:41] which is the strategy change. So let's create a being that holds the new.
[01:03:41 - 01:03:46] strategy that we can interact with because we can't talk to the CEO let's
[01:03:46 - 01:03:51] say all the time to embody that strategy. How would I employ this new strategy in
[01:03:51 - 01:03:56] the marketing department that I'm a part of? I like that too.
[01:03:57 - 01:04:05] I like your wording communication getting lost, because that has so much into it.
[01:04:08 - 01:04:12] I'm thinking about well-being, obviously.
[01:04:12 - 01:04:21] And I'm thinking that a lot of companies today actually have problems with well-being.
[01:04:21 - 01:04:27] People are not, you know, feeling comfortable, they don't have safety or feel safe in the
[01:04:27 - 01:04:27] workplace.
[01:04:27 - 01:04:34] organization and again this is also a complex area there you can do coaching
[01:04:34 - 01:04:43] but you don't really know how to capture that in a systematic way and really get
[01:04:42 - 01:04:48] the clues on how to do changes or doing the right changes because it's human
[01:04:48 - 01:04:54] interactions where sort of the well-being is seen or not seen. So I'm
[01:04:54 - 01:04:58] thinking that that could also be a
[01:04:57 - 01:05:02] topic where, for example, I don't know if you know about the Inner Development Goals?
[01:05:02 - 01:05:08] Yeah, so obviously a lot of companies are now catching on to that, but then I think
[01:05:08 - 01:05:12] the magic will be how do we actually use that?
[01:05:12 - 01:05:19] that in our organization and how do we capture sort of these capabilities that we seem to need
[01:05:20 - 01:05:25] in order to take us to the next level no matter the strategy but you know we're saying that we
[01:05:25 - 01:05:26] want to strengthen.
[01:05:27 - 01:05:32] strengthen our organisation within the development goals and make it valuable in the meaning
[01:05:32 - 01:05:34] and how do we do that.
[01:05:34 - 01:05:40] And that is very complex to capture in an organisation because it's a lot of individuals
[01:05:40 - 01:05:42] and a lot of data.
[01:05:42 - 01:05:45] that is not so transparent.
[01:05:51 - 01:05:57] I think what's the key with AI is obviously everything that is too complex for humans.
[01:05:57 - 01:06:06] humans to really capture and conclude on or take the next step to that's where
[01:06:06 - 01:06:13] you have a business case for this and in organizations that is so
[01:06:12 - 01:06:18] obvious because it's all humans and I think everyone knows that it's a you know, we're all people and
[01:06:18 - 01:06:24] If your company is to succeed it depends on the people no matter what so you need to
[01:06:25 - 01:06:27] make that equation
[01:06:27 - 01:06:34] work and that is so hard to do. It's impossible for people to do actually
[01:06:34 - 01:06:38] because there's so many fears, so many different agendas, so many different
[01:06:38 - 01:06:43] values in an organization that you don't really see.
[01:06:42 - 01:06:48] So, if you can make that more transparent and also making everyone aware and knowing
[01:06:48 - 01:06:53] that this is the way we're going or this is what is expected of you and this is what makes
[01:06:53 - 01:06:57] you contribute in the best way.
[01:06:57 - 01:07:03] And a lot of well-being will come from that, actually, because everyone wants to do something.
[01:07:03 - 01:07:09] They want to do good for themselves and make a good job, more or less.
[01:07:09 - 01:07:12] So if an AI assistant can help...
[01:07:12 - 01:07:18] them do that and understand what they're doing, what behaviours, what actions, what they spend
[01:07:18 - 01:07:24] their time on is actually moving them in the direction that they want internally as well.
[01:07:24 - 01:07:27] That is really important.
[01:07:27 - 01:07:34] I actually kept from the other question she said that speak from the heart and
[01:07:34 - 01:07:39] speaking from the heart is very very hard for people to do because it takes a
[01:07:39 - 01:07:42] lot of courage and
[01:07:42 - 01:07:48] Humans are driven by fear, and that is a survival mechanism that we have.
[01:07:48 - 01:07:57] In order to survive, we are fearful for a lot of things, which I think is natural.
[01:07:57 - 01:08:05] in organizations, fear is really an obstacle. So I'm thinking a little bit about how can
[01:08:06 - 01:08:12] Alanya, or what's her name, Alanya. It comes from, it's a Hawaiian word for
[01:08:12 - 01:08:18] short for Laniakea which is the name of our galactic supercluster and it means
[01:08:18 - 01:08:28] immeasurable heaven. That's a lot of dense information in the name.
[01:08:27 - 01:08:35] Lania is Hawaiian, short for Laniakea, which means immeasurable heaven, and it's the name
[01:08:35 - 01:08:42] of our galactic supercluster, so millions of galaxies flowing in a river in space time.
[01:08:42 - 01:08:46] I love it, it's so true, it's still in the bar.
[01:08:46 - 01:08:48] It's our excuse for getting lost in space.
[01:08:48 - 01:08:49] Yeah.
[01:08:50 - 01:08:51] Now I get it.
[01:08:51 - 01:08:54] Okay, more reflections, popcorn style.
[01:08:54 - 01:08:55] Yeah, I have some.
[01:08:55 - 01:08:57] Like, if I'm looking at the companies where I work as an engineer, I can...
[01:08:57 - 01:09:02] and I see what was actually like in my everyday life that I also seen in that
[01:09:02 - 01:09:10] aspect is is again back to how we can be as much closer to our own wisdom and
[01:09:10 - 01:09:14] that is through safety and I sort of feel safe
[01:09:13 - 01:09:20] safe, like nervous system, the tone of our voices, the speed of how fast we talk, how
[01:09:20 - 01:09:22] much we get reflected or not.
[01:09:22 - 01:09:27] So if we know, if we look at the valuable words of the book.
[01:09:28 - 01:09:34] my consultant company where I work now, it's like connection, exploration and challenge
[01:09:34 - 01:09:41] are like the core words for the whole company to do and everyone knows that if this can
[01:09:41 - 01:09:42] support us to connect.
[01:09:43 - 01:09:50] and become more safe in the room, they would see value of that, just with those few words.
[01:09:50 - 01:09:58] Because that's within the tolerance window of cognitive understanding of what's important.
[01:09:58 - 01:10:03] And they see that that's a core value, and they see how powerful that can be.
[01:10:03 - 01:10:07] So less words in this can sometimes be really, I think it can be powerful.
[01:10:07 - 01:10:13] And if Alandia can help with that, to support that kind of, you know, nice...
[01:10:13 - 01:10:17] gentle way, see what's needed in the room to facilitate a more safe way of
[01:10:17 - 01:10:20] communication. That's really, really valuable.
[01:10:20 - 01:10:28] Yeah. I want to share, like, like, there's so much.
[01:10:28 - 01:10:32] potential in when you connect, like the human connection part, but also the
[01:10:32 - 01:10:37] technical, like if you surface, if you connect the data and you surface it and
[01:10:37 - 01:10:40] it's meaningful, then that's like supercharging.
[01:10:40 - 01:10:43] And then if you have memory that retains it.
[01:10:43 - 01:10:50] over time so that you actually don't lose 99 or 999.9% of everything or the value
[01:10:50 - 01:10:53] that's happening in an organization, it just dissipates.
[01:10:53 - 01:10:54] Right.
[01:10:55 - 01:10:57] And and the way to do that is like any.
[01:10:58 - 01:11:04] Any living system or any AI needs an objective function. It needs like something to strive towards
[01:11:05 - 01:11:07] and
[01:11:07 - 01:11:09] So you imbue it with
[01:11:10 - 01:11:13] carefully curated or selected objective
[01:11:13 - 01:11:19] function, we need to think very deeply on that, which becomes the meta-framework in
[01:11:19 - 01:11:26] how we program this thing, so that it guides human beings towards more, I would call, connectedness.
[01:11:26 - 01:11:28] But then what you can do is, like, you just have to be...
[01:11:28 - 01:11:36] contextually relevant, right? So each organization has their own, like, developmental, like, levels and challenges. It has its own...
[01:11:37 - 01:11:43] Like, even the best organizations strive towards some kind of value system, but the...
[01:11:43 - 01:11:48] they use it as a paper product to hit people in the head with, like, we're not challenging enough
[01:11:48 - 01:11:54] here or whatever. But if you could weave that into, on top of, this whole sub-meta framework,
[01:11:54 - 01:11:58] like, and you can do that, like, in a meeting.
[01:11:58 - 01:12:05] the participants to more, I think you said it well Aditya, like I'm going to say it with my own words,
[01:12:05 - 01:12:13] like alignment or coordination around what we're actually here to do and when we're deviant.
[01:12:13 - 01:12:20] from that then we get nudged back. So we want we want this to actually challenge
[01:12:20 - 01:12:25] I think that came up in the beginning as well, like don't conform too much but
[01:12:25 - 01:12:30] actually invite diverse viewpoints and so the AI can still
[01:12:28 - 01:12:31] and for the diverse viewpoints that is actually in alignment with us.
[01:12:31 - 01:12:35] We didn't feel it, we didn't know it, we didn't see it.
[01:12:35 - 01:12:38] So it's bringing us back into that alignment from the authentic place.
[01:12:39 - 01:12:40] I think that's very powerful.
[01:12:40 - 01:12:42] And it ties into the
[01:12:43 - 01:12:48] Yeah, a very core need that at least the management team has, or any team, basically.
[01:12:49 - 01:12:51] So then my popcorn question is...
[01:12:54 - 01:12:55] I should have to pop on this one.
[01:12:56 - 01:12:58] Yeah, I have something to add after you.
[01:12:58 - 01:12:59] Thank you, Angela.
[01:12:59 - 01:13:00] This is on this one.
[01:13:00 - 01:13:01] Yeah.
[01:13:01 - 01:13:02] So who's first?
[01:13:02 - 01:13:03] She was popping.
[01:13:03 - 01:13:04] Yeah.
[01:13:04 - 01:13:05] Lotta, Chris, and then Aditya.
[01:13:05 - 01:13:06] Don't have to apologize for popping.
[01:13:06 - 01:13:07] Pop on.
[01:13:07 - 01:13:08] But yeah.
[01:13:13 - 01:13:24] Since we're so conformed and we know what we're talking about, how are we going to talk about this to the ones that haven't got a clue what this could be?
[01:13:24 - 01:13:28] I need more simple words on what you're saying.
[01:13:28 - 01:13:43] But I think you guys have said it so well already, saying that do you want to
[01:13:44 - 01:13:51] strategy to come true really you know that is that is the essence for a
[01:13:51 - 01:13:57] company yes I do yes okay then you need the people on board how do you ensure
[01:13:57 - 01:14:00] that the people are on board
[01:13:59 - 01:14:01] Let us help you with that.
[01:14:01 - 01:14:09] So do you want your employees to embrace your corporate values?
[01:14:09 - 01:14:12] Yes, we do, obviously.
[01:14:12 - 01:14:14] OK, let us help you reinforce.
[01:14:14 - 01:14:29] that, so we help the organization understand and feel the core values of the company.
[01:14:29 - 01:14:38] So, I want to lean into that second thing that you said about presenting disagreement in a forceful way.
[01:14:38 - 01:14:41] I don't know what exactly what you said, but it's the same.
[01:14:41 - 01:14:44] And I really like when...
[01:14:44 - 01:14:51] what Aditya said in relation to like how do we reach an early majority or late majority
[01:14:51 - 01:14:58] then it really is about like if we want to impact your insurance, German insurance company
[01:14:58 - 01:14:59] then having that
[01:14:59 - 01:15:04] logic like how do we align around a predefined strategy like that is
[01:15:04 - 01:15:10] probably very alive for them but when I'm in this room like that intention
[01:15:10 - 01:15:16] especially in regards to like what rivers want
[01:15:14 - 01:15:21] to be in regards to decentralization does nothing for me. It feels like zero magic.
[01:15:22 - 01:15:29] But I like it that it can reach the early majority. That is a great thing about that view.
[01:15:29 - 01:15:35] point but what I'm more curious about is like how do you reach the early adopters
[01:15:35 - 01:15:41] at this stage like and you say this thing with it's about contextualizing
[01:15:41 - 01:15:46] it right and all the
[01:15:44 - 01:15:49] are different how do you take this technology into one company one context
[01:15:49 - 01:15:56] different from another but and just like I think starting with a business where
[01:15:56 - 01:16:01] it's not a stretch like they want to maybe
[01:15:59 - 01:16:05] the leadership wants to source what the wisdom of the entire organization like
[01:16:05 - 01:16:10] where they have that intention of finding the commonality that is already
[01:16:10 - 01:16:16] heartfelt and aligned like a book
[01:16:14 - 01:16:21] up strategies, I think that would be a much more, like a context that I would be much
[01:16:21 - 01:16:29] more curious to see what River can do. And once it's like proven as a context,
[01:16:29 - 01:16:37] concept to do that, and that that leads to this alignment, then later people in the adoption
[01:16:37 - 01:16:42] cycle would become curious, I think.
[01:16:42 - 01:16:44] And I think, like, what company that...
[01:16:44 - 01:16:48] look for maybe like these organizations that where you say you're an engineer
[01:16:48 - 01:16:55] and people like everyone will get the value of connection if you say that like
[01:16:55 - 01:17:01] that is a card you can really play and that makes sense
[01:16:59 - 01:17:06] That's where I would like to see it implemented, in green or yellow organizations, if we take
[01:17:06 - 01:17:09] those spiral dynamics colors.
[01:17:09 - 01:17:10] Yeah.
[01:17:10 - 01:17:11] Nice.
[01:17:11 - 01:17:12] Yeah.
[01:17:12 - 01:17:14] Maybe, can I go after you, Aditya?
[01:17:14 - 01:17:19] Or you can go, Patrick, if you're relating to that.
[01:17:19 - 01:17:24] No, I'm actually relating to more than everyone.
[01:17:24 - 01:17:29] Okay. Okay.
[01:17:29 - 01:17:36] Okay, yeah, that was a wonderful point, Chris.
[01:17:36 - 01:17:42] I am also troubled with the problem that you're trying to solve, yeah, and I was a little
[01:17:42 - 01:17:44] bit sold, Stephan.
[01:17:44 - 01:17:52] was talking about maybe like almost like imbuing some really beautiful ethic in, you know,
[01:17:52 - 01:17:59] underneath, even though we sell in a very basic way to the insurance company.
[01:17:59 - 01:18:03] I'm still and but I do have another idea. That's it's similar
[01:18:04 - 01:18:06] so I
[01:18:06 - 01:18:09] Don't have faith that the AI like imagine I was an AI
[01:18:11 - 01:18:14] Unless it's as real as me that I would actually be
[01:18:14 - 01:18:20] able to even think, you know, I'm on the screen, right? And you guys are in person. So how much
[01:18:20 - 01:18:24] am I really going to be able to affect your dynamic, even as a real human? So I don't have
[01:18:24 - 01:18:29] faith that, you know, today, the AI will be able to like interrupt the
[01:18:30 - 01:18:33] meeting in real time and unless people are really,
[01:18:33 - 01:18:35] you know, like typing in questions
[01:18:35 - 01:18:38] and they give us space for that.
[01:18:38 - 01:18:40] But so I was thinking about, you know,
[01:18:40 - 01:18:43] how could it still be of use?
[01:18:43 - 01:18:45] So I was thinking about wellbeing.
[01:18:45 - 01:18:55] as an example. Even if you look at just notes, no voice, facial texture, no video, I've looked
[01:18:55 - 01:19:00] at meeting notes with AI. You can say 20% of the time people were in a problem.
[01:19:00 - 01:19:04] problem-solving mode, and 40% of the time they were kind of like stroking their own
[01:19:04 - 01:19:10] ego, you know, trying to play some kind of political game or something like that.
[01:19:10 - 01:19:15] And then I was thinking of, in several ways, one is, yeah, post-hoc, after the meeting
[01:19:15 - 01:19:20] meeting has happened, were they reflecting the strategy or the values of the company?
[01:19:20 - 01:19:28] But also, let's say we had all the meetings from a particular company for the last week,
[01:19:28 - 01:19:30] what kind of problems are we seeing that we
[01:19:30 - 01:19:34] didn't even anticipate, you know, there's a real problem in morale.
[01:19:36 - 01:19:39] People are questioning the leaders, the mission.
[01:19:41 - 01:19:45] People have a moral disagreement with the change that we.
[01:19:45 - 01:19:52] made last week. So things that, you know, would hopefully provoke more responsibility
[01:19:52 - 01:19:56] from an HR team, you know, like, oh, we need to reach out, but, or from the leadership
[01:19:56 - 01:20:00] team, like, oh, we really have a actual ethical problem or conflict.
[01:20:00 - 01:20:02] that we need to address.
[01:20:02 - 01:20:06] So I was thinking as more of a silent listener
[01:20:06 - 01:20:10] that is wise enough to make patterns,
[01:20:10 - 01:20:12] find patterns in a given meeting,
[01:20:12 - 01:20:15] in a given department, or across the whole company.
[01:20:15 - 01:20:17] I think that's so good, I just want to say that.
[01:20:17 - 01:20:19] Yeah, I just want to...
[01:20:19 - 01:20:21] May I challenge that then?
[01:20:21 - 01:20:23] After me.
[01:20:23 - 01:20:25] You're next in line.
[01:20:25 - 01:20:27] I have something I need to say.
[01:20:27 - 01:20:29] Patrick, who goes first?
[01:20:30 - 01:20:33] OK, you go, then me.
[01:20:33 - 01:20:36] I think what I see as a challenge,
[01:20:36 - 01:20:38] and this is partly also a question back,
[01:20:38 - 01:20:41] is that what you're saying is basically organizations
[01:20:41 - 01:20:43] are driven by fear.
[01:20:43 - 01:20:46] And people who have power.
[01:20:45 - 01:20:50] actually survive based on the people fear them for the power they have over
[01:20:50 - 01:20:56] 90% of most companies are driven by efficiency efficiency efficiency short
[01:20:56 - 01:21:02] term targets of month maybe quarter
[01:21:00 - 01:21:06] And actually, you're not better than the last quarter you performed, right?
[01:21:06 - 01:21:13] That means that they're chasing efficiency as the core way to prove the company's existence
[01:21:13 - 01:21:15] going future, and your role if you were deceased.
[01:21:15 - 01:21:21] The amount of companies that you describe, we start to realize that there's a bigger
[01:21:21 - 01:21:26] need for deeper connection, that it's not enough for the management team to cover the
[01:21:26 - 01:21:27] complexity of the work.
[01:21:27 - 01:21:30] Those are very few.
[01:21:30 - 01:21:38] do not follow traditional industry specifics. They're on individual basis so
[01:21:38 - 01:21:41] it has to do with what kind of leadership grow in that company based on
[01:21:41 - 01:21:47] who they are. Our challenge is how do we find those?
[01:21:45 - 01:21:52] because the others are not ready this is too big of a challenge so we need to
[01:21:52 - 01:21:57] find those we need to profile those and figure out how to reach them that's
[01:21:57 - 01:22:02] where we need to be because the others
[01:22:00 - 01:22:07] I'm perfect, don't disturb my centralized control.
[01:22:15 - 01:22:30] I think it's like Anna is zooming out, but there is a whisper.
[01:22:30 - 01:22:35] here, which is very interesting. There's something that wants to be born and I can sense into it.
[01:22:35 - 01:22:41] There are some facets and I just love how we challenge each other also. So I'm really curious
[01:22:41 - 01:22:45] about your perspective. But I think like...
[01:22:45 - 01:22:58] what I want to say here there's like a time horizon so how did we call refer to
[01:22:58 - 01:23:02] this like one year ago when we talked about
[01:23:00 - 01:23:05] one of our senior advisors who said like,
[01:23:05 - 01:23:10] you can have like, yeah, if there's like a staircase,
[01:23:10 - 01:23:12] like either they're mission aligned,
[01:23:12 - 01:23:14] and it's like tight fit,
[01:23:14 - 01:23:16] like we're feeling mission aligned in this room.
[01:23:15 - 01:23:23] room, right? Or second tier is like they're mission curious, like the early doctors or
[01:23:23 - 01:23:27] early majority and they're not sure what they want to just know that it's not that thing
[01:23:27 - 01:23:31] that we used to do. Like the curiosity is there, but they haven't embraced it.
[01:23:31 - 01:23:35] embodied it yet or practiced it yet.
[01:23:35 - 01:23:41] And then there's like mission neutral, which is like organizations that are, they're not
[01:23:41 - 01:23:45] trying to do harm and hopefully they're not doing too much harm, they're just doing their
[01:23:45 - 01:23:45] thing.
[01:23:46 - 01:23:52] And most of them are quite corporate, like I would say like a grocery chain in Sweden.
[01:23:52 - 01:23:56] Like, okay, they're just trying to sell food, but they're also putting candy
[01:23:56 - 01:24:00] close to the cashier, which fucks up all the children's parents.
[01:24:01 - 01:24:03] and they're going to navigate the children through.
[01:24:03 - 01:24:04] And the children.
[01:24:04 - 01:24:05] Yes, and the children.
[01:24:05 - 01:24:09] But at least they're doing their best, in quotation marks.
[01:24:09 - 01:24:15] But then they have the mission, like the, how would you call it, misaligned.
[01:24:16 - 01:24:18] That are truly going the opposite direction
[01:24:18 - 01:24:24] like pumping up oil and spewing it into the atmosphere or selling tobacco or like
[01:24:24 - 01:24:28] Those kinds of companies and I think I've been thinking about this for a while like
[01:24:29 - 01:24:31] What's the for River?
[01:24:31 - 01:24:35] like strategic entry points because I agree with you Chris like and it feels
[01:24:35 - 01:24:39] more alive to start with a mission aligned and find those gems and have a
[01:24:39 - 01:24:45] strategy for that and like work on that at the same time I'm really drawn
[01:24:45 - 01:24:48] towards
[01:24:46 - 01:24:49] like the equalizer that you're expressing in detail,
[01:24:49 - 01:24:54] like what is the underlying value or feature
[01:24:54 - 01:24:59] or core value proposition that would work in all contexts?
[01:25:01 - 01:25:07] but that would be contextual and it's and for me it's not mission misaligned
[01:25:07 - 01:25:11] to to work with the company that's doing that because what we're doing is we're
[01:25:11 - 01:25:18] actually building out the infrastructure and then and we can see
[01:25:16 - 01:25:23] sell it and it can be proprietary in the corporate domain, but we're also going to build it open
[01:25:23 - 01:25:28] source and release it to the world and have players play with it and build this ecosystem.
[01:25:30 - 01:25:31] So for me, we can do both.
[01:25:31 - 01:25:41] There's not a conflict, it's just that we have to figure out like what's the strategic or maybe tactical decision here, I think, and I don't have the answer, I'm just putting words behind it.
[01:25:41 - 01:25:43] I want to say one more thing.
[01:25:43 - 01:25:46] I think the Trojan horse, so to speak, is...
[01:25:46 - 01:25:48] how we define wisdom.
[01:25:48 - 01:25:50] There's so many ways to define it,
[01:25:50 - 01:25:52] but I think these three dimensions that I mentioned
[01:25:52 - 01:25:54] is quite good.
[01:25:54 - 01:25:56] Wisdom, at least for me, is to
[01:25:56 - 01:25:58] improve outcomes.
[01:25:58 - 01:26:00] That's like the densest version.
[01:26:01 - 01:26:07] but it goes through self-transcendence, it goes across time and across space.
[01:26:08 - 01:26:12] So we have these three dimensions, like if you have a long time horizon in your decisions,
[01:26:13 - 01:26:16] you have a holistic mind and then you can also
[01:26:16 - 01:26:24] And then you have the meta loop that re-evaluates your whole wisdom action logic over time.
[01:26:24 - 01:26:29] That is something, you don't even have to say wisdom, but if it's in the system and
[01:26:29 - 01:26:31] it's nudging decisions.
[01:26:31 - 01:26:35] towards becoming more of that in a win-win manner,
[01:26:35 - 01:26:39] then they will make better decisions for themselves too
[01:26:39 - 01:26:41] as a leadership or management team.
[01:26:41 - 01:26:43] They're gonna make better decisions.
[01:26:43 - 01:26:44] So I just wanna put it out there.
[01:26:44 - 01:26:46] It's like, that could be the bridge.
[01:26:46 - 01:26:50] that the soil or the foundation upon which we build the other stuff.
[01:26:52 - 01:26:54] So, yeah.
[01:26:54 - 01:26:59] Okay, challenging on several fronts here. Okay, I'm going to challenge you first.
[01:27:00 - 01:27:02] You said that
[01:27:01 - 01:27:08] One thing that you need to be careful about is this secret agent in an organization.
[01:27:08 - 01:27:10] We hear you. We see you.
[01:27:10 - 01:27:13] I think that is something to...
[01:27:13 - 01:27:16] That is...
[01:27:16 - 01:27:21] opposite of making people feel safe you know if they feel that they are
[01:27:21 - 01:27:28] listening to in you know their meetings and they don't interact with the agent I
[01:27:28 - 01:27:33] think that is dangerous and I don't think that is sort of good
[01:27:31 - 01:27:38] because you will always have some suspicions towards saying that how are
[01:27:38 - 01:27:42] you using this data how are you using this information so it needs to be very
[01:27:42 - 01:27:48] conscious and very so transparent yes
[01:27:47 - 01:27:55] So, and then when it comes to those companies, actually I think it is a lot of companies
[01:27:55 - 01:27:57] actually want this.
[01:27:57 - 01:28:01] Because every company wants to reach their goals.
[01:28:02 - 01:28:08] get their strategy. And old companies are more or less failing on it. I mean, do you know a company
[01:28:08 - 01:28:14] who actually, you know, managed to reach their strategy or, you know, reach their goals? It's
[01:28:14 - 01:28:16] not that many. So and
[01:28:17 - 01:28:20] And that's, I think, what a lot of management teams are thinking about.
[01:28:20 - 01:28:22] How can we actually make this happen?
[01:28:22 - 01:28:25] So, you know, make your strategy fly.
[01:28:25 - 01:28:28] And then I'm wondering a little bit what you're saying.
[01:28:28 - 01:28:30] I'm all into this.
[01:28:30 - 01:28:31] I understand the whole...
[01:28:32 - 01:28:38] concept of wisdom and the collective intelligence in in organizations and how
[01:28:38 - 01:28:48] to reduce barriers to actually move forward together. However, is it so that
[01:28:47 - 01:28:57] if you let's say buy this product do you need to understand and buy into the full
[01:28:57 - 01:29:03] concept or can it just be there anyway I mean
[01:29:02 - 01:29:08] It's a little bit of masking, maybe, but to start with, I mean, really, what the business
[01:29:08 - 01:29:12] need is, is how do we improve our meetings?
[01:29:12 - 01:29:16] How do we improve our sort of work to reach our goals?
[01:29:16 - 01:29:17] How do we...
[01:29:17 - 01:29:24] improve the collaboration in this team.
[01:29:32 - 01:29:38] reach the targets and make shareholders and everyone happy is how you solve it today.
[01:29:38 - 01:29:41] You use the McKinsey's to do the strategy and to help you implement it and then you
[01:29:41 - 01:29:47] use another consultant to help you do the organizational change and do leadership coaching.
[01:29:47 - 01:29:50] So they've tried that, they've spent millions on that.
[01:29:50 - 01:29:57] We produce or provide a different approach to doing that, that is extremely different.
[01:29:57 - 01:30:01] And like why the people didn't know they needed the iPhone, because if you ask them they couldn't
[01:30:01 - 01:30:02] figure it out.
[01:30:02 - 01:30:07] figure it out. They didn't have that capability to know that that's what really what they wanted.
[01:30:08 - 01:30:17] So how to convince them to basically see and dare to try a different way to do it.
[01:30:17 - 01:30:32] And on the second thing that you said that do they need to buy into the whole concept, I think what's going to happen is that over time, you will start to realize at one point that hey guys, we just achieved collective intelligence and it changed everything.
[01:30:32 - 01:30:47] Exactly. But it needs safety, it needs trust, it needs a new governance model eventually, it needs a new way of decentralizing decision-making and the third thing is that one thing
[01:30:47 - 01:31:02] And I think in the chase to achieve your goals and your targets, one thing that a lot of companies have stopped doing, they say that they're innovation companies, but they're really fixing problems kind of companies.
[01:31:02 - 01:31:09] So they're improving on things, maybe, but they're not necessarily innovating to make
[01:31:09 - 01:31:14] long-term bigger changes, because they don't have time, resources, and money.
[01:31:14 - 01:31:17] It's too costly compared to saving money.
[01:31:17 - 01:31:19] and make the targets.
[01:31:21 - 01:31:23] If I look at what I can do today
[01:31:23 - 01:31:25] I can do a
[01:31:25 - 01:31:27] I can investigate
[01:31:27 - 01:31:29] a thing that would take me 2-3 months
[01:31:29 - 01:31:31] in one and a half
[01:31:31 - 01:31:33] two days
[01:31:32 - 01:31:42] Instead of one thing to focus on, I can do 25 or 30 and also figure out well in time
[01:31:42 - 01:31:45] when to stop and say, this is not going to go, I don't have to spend more time, it's
[01:31:45 - 01:31:47] not going to work, I need to take a different diet.
[01:31:47 - 01:31:57] Giving them access to that would also make them be able to explore more opportunities than they can technically get today.
[01:31:57 - 01:32:00] That's also an opportunity.
[01:32:00 - 01:32:02] I have a short pop.
[01:32:02 - 01:32:11] We are talking about companies only. What about NGOs? Extremely value-driven and really target-oriented.
[01:32:11 - 01:32:15] We want, you know, hand-in-hand. We want to reduce poverty in the world.
[01:32:15 - 01:32:17] We want to...
[01:32:18 - 01:32:25] strength of the capability of women and you know it's what about the NGO world
[01:32:25 - 01:32:34] have you you know it's good I think that I want to insert
[01:32:33 - 01:32:36] insert some context, if I may.
[01:32:36 - 01:32:39] I want to insert some meta-context before.
[01:32:39 - 01:32:40] Ouch!
[01:32:40 - 01:32:44] Before you go meta, I'm going to correct some things.
[01:32:44 - 01:32:45] What?
[01:32:45 - 01:32:46] Yes.
[01:32:46 - 01:32:48] No, this is what I'm metaing.
[01:32:48 - 01:32:52] We're popping too quickly. I've lost the sense of Wii space that I intended earlier.
[01:32:52 - 01:32:55] It's fragmenting. I need... yeah.
[01:32:55 - 01:32:56] Okay, good.
[01:32:56 - 01:33:03] Good. So, my pop is for myself to be able to be more present.
[01:33:03 - 01:33:10] I'm going to speak on a few questions that are, to me, floating, that I would like to speak on.
[01:33:10 - 01:33:13] And one question was how do you reach those companies?
[01:33:13 - 01:33:17] And what I know is that I work in one of them.
[01:33:18 - 01:33:24] So they actually truly live in their values, the first ever place I feel that.
[01:33:24 - 01:33:33] And my other experience of life and doing this is that we don't need to find a full organisation that loves it.
[01:33:33 - 01:33:41] We need to find the people and we have to follow the river. We have to follow the river of connection in the networks we already have.
[01:33:41 - 01:33:48] I have a lot of connections and I know even in my old company, the old company was pretty good.
[01:33:48 - 01:33:53] slow but some people in the company are not so we need to more look at like how
[01:33:53 - 01:33:57] can we get into that because if we go into those spaces the curiosity will
[01:33:57 - 01:34:02] have its own way like what that's water flows it will find its easiest path into
[01:34:02 - 01:34:05] the organization
[01:34:03 - 01:34:11] and then over time it will rupture even the concrete, whatever, over time the river will come into it.
[01:34:11 - 01:34:15] So we don't need to look at one organization as not applicable for this,
[01:34:15 - 01:34:18] because if they seem like on a higher level they don't.
[01:34:18 - 01:34:24] want to listen we see if we can come in personally towards whoever is listening and if we find one
[01:34:24 - 01:34:30] company they know two others because they are also connected like if i would if we would speak
[01:34:30 - 01:34:33] the network we have yes in the personal connections
[01:34:33 - 01:34:40] So if we come to a company and they are a right fist, they will know other companies that surely are a right fist.
[01:34:40 - 01:34:43] So that's on how we can find companies.
[01:34:43 - 01:34:48] And on you speaking of where to aim, I think it's...
[01:34:48 - 01:34:53] one on what you say to aim both on those early adopters but also look at how we
[01:34:53 - 01:35:01] can just present it in another way because it also makes us more challenged
[01:35:01 - 01:35:05] in how we think so it will keep us fresh
[01:35:03 - 01:35:09] we can twist and turn this into something that looks whatever it needs to look like for a specific
[01:35:09 - 01:35:16] aspect. And I know that we're peer-driven, but beneath that we're love-driven. We're actually
[01:35:16 - 01:35:18] wired for love. So I think that we...
[01:35:18 - 01:35:26] aspect of one way is believing in that we don't have to play with fear we can
[01:35:26 - 01:35:30] play with love because in that way we will really touch people in a way that
[01:35:30 - 01:35:35] we don't have to fear anyone and curiosity will have its
[01:35:33 - 01:35:39] own path in this and so one thing I find you said was really important is like people are afraid of
[01:35:39 - 01:35:44] people listening in but if it's a possibility and I can choose to put it on and off we will
[01:35:44 - 01:35:48] start to get curious like if there's a bottom here and if we turn it on it's like we was in this
[01:35:48 - 01:35:55] soon we will start to push it. And then I choose to invite her into the meeting rather than having
[01:35:55 - 01:36:01] a company saying that now everyone should have this. Exactly. So yeah, that was me. Thank you.
[01:36:02 - 01:36:03] Nice.
[01:36:04 - 01:36:18] Yes, that's a good thing, actually.
[01:36:19 - 01:36:21] Closing, or, yeah?
[01:36:21 - 01:36:23] Yeah.
...
...
...
[01:37:19 - 01:37:34] Thank you.
[01:37:34 - 01:37:49] I just want to say thank you to everyone for the level of engagement, it's nice.
[01:37:49 - 01:37:56] that's probably a good place. I asked before the meditation, like, what are the
[01:37:56 - 01:38:02] themes in this part of the dialogue? I can just reflect back. And then we
[01:38:02 - 01:38:06] actually have a prepared question.
[01:38:04 - 01:38:10] we can see if we want to ask it. But several key themes emerge. So the importance of emotional
[01:38:10 - 01:38:15] self-safety in organizational settings, particular on meetings and communication.
[01:38:16 - 01:38:19] You're exploring how to create environments where people feel secure to express
[01:38:19 - 01:38:25] themselves authentically. The role of AI augmentation in enhancing human
[01:38:25 - 01:38:28] connection rather than replacing it. You're discussing ways technology can
[01:38:28 - 01:38:31] support better understanding and collaboration while maintaining human
[01:38:31 - 01:38:34] values at the center.
[01:38:34 - 01:38:37] Tension between efficiency and meaningful engagement.
[01:38:37 - 01:38:39] Recognizing how organizations often prioritize
[01:38:39 - 01:38:42] short-term results over deeper, more sustainable approaches
[01:38:42 - 01:38:44] to growth and innovation.
[01:38:44 - 01:38:46] And lastly, the need for authentic leadership
[01:38:46 - 01:38:47] and communication.
[01:38:47 - 01:38:49] So you're exploring how transparency.
[01:38:49 - 01:38:53] and genuine expression can transform organizational culture and effectiveness.
[01:38:53 - 01:38:59] So these are topics or themes, but I think I sense we were on another deeper level
[01:39:00 - 01:39:03] talking about what's the actual core value.
[01:39:04 - 01:39:11] Yeah, maybe we should go into that.
[01:39:11 - 01:39:16] We had a question here, like, based on the pain points and value proposition that we
[01:39:16 - 01:39:19] explore what emerging patterns reveal the most promising opportunities for
[01:39:19 - 01:39:28] impact. Should we try it? I should share. Sorry Aditya.
[01:39:34 - 01:39:49] Okay, so looking at the recent dialogue, several are promising opportunities.
[01:39:49 - 01:39:55] emerge from the intersection of pain points and value. So the need for
[01:39:55 - 01:39:58] psychological safety in meetings is creating an opening for tools that
[01:39:58 - 01:40:04] enhance authentic communication while respecting privacy. You're seeing how AI
[01:40:04 - 01:40:06] enabled insights.
[01:40:04 - 01:40:11] These insights could help leaders better understand and address underlying dynamics that currently limit engagement.
[01:40:11 - 01:40:17] There is significant potential in bridging the gap between strategic vision and day-to-day implementation.
[01:40:17 - 01:40:19] Yes, you are identifying ways to help organize your work.
[01:40:19 - 01:40:23] organizations translate high-level goals into meaningful actions through better
[01:40:23 - 01:40:27] alignment and communication. And the challenge of balancing efficiency with
[01:40:27 - 01:40:31] human connection points to an opportunity for technology that enhances
[01:40:31 - 01:40:33] rather than replaces authentic interaction.
[01:40:33 - 01:40:36] We are exploring how AI can...
[01:40:35 - 01:40:39] augment natural human wisdom while preserving core values.
[01:40:39 - 01:40:44] Would you like to explore any of these patterns more deeply?
[01:40:44 - 01:40:47] For me personally, the middle one resonates.
[01:40:47 - 01:40:50] I mean all of them do, but there's significant potential.
[01:40:50 - 01:40:53] bridging the gap between strategic vision and day-to-day implementation
[01:40:53 - 01:40:56] because it needs the other ones
[01:41:05 - 01:41:20] I'm going to ask the other question to just to get it so based on
[01:41:20 - 01:41:24] our conversation what key insights, if we acted on them, would lead to the best possible outcome.
[01:41:27 - 01:41:31] So it's not one-shotting this one now because there's actually a deeper analysis in the
[01:41:31 - 01:41:35] background so we can look at that later.
[01:41:35 - 01:41:40] The two powerful insights stand out that could lead to transformative outcomes.
[01:41:40 - 01:41:47] So first, recognition that emotional safety is foundational to organizational effectiveness.
[01:41:47 - 01:41:50] You're seeing that when people feel secure, they express themselves authentically.
[01:41:50 - 01:41:55] Basically it unlocks deeper engagement and innovation, creating environments that nurture
[01:41:55 - 01:41:59] this psychological safety could revolutionize how teams collaborate.
[01:41:59 - 01:42:03] And second, the understanding that AI can serve as a bridge between efficiency and meaningful
[01:42:03 - 01:42:05] human connection.
[01:42:05 - 01:42:10] you're exploring how technology can enhance rather than replace. Acting on
[01:42:10 - 01:42:13] these insights could lead to a new paradigm where technology and human
[01:42:13 - 01:42:18] wisdom work together. I think they are too generic for me and I think it's
[01:42:18 - 01:42:21] weighing
[01:42:20 - 01:42:27] Parts of organization like we experience I think in our session like it's it's it's picking up some patterns
[01:42:27 - 01:42:29] And it's going deep into that
[01:42:32 - 01:42:34] Yes
[01:42:35 - 01:42:45] We're finding so many ways to solve pain points, but I think one pain point is the leaders
[01:42:45 - 01:42:49] of the, say, private sector team or whatever,
[01:42:50 - 01:42:58] Or are they ready to be challenged with this super intelligent, human, friendly, whatever it is.
[01:42:58 - 01:43:05] We're not even talking about that. It's like given, yeah, everyone is going to embrace and invite this in.
[01:43:05 - 01:43:08] But for me, that's the pain point.
[01:43:08 - 01:43:14] How can this even be invited to explore and see what can happen?
[01:43:14 - 01:43:20] Because we are relying on what it can do and what it can create.
[01:43:20 - 01:43:35] We also talk very much in River that you need to sense and explore how this can change me or help me or whatever me, but are they ready to give that a chance or give it time? That's my question.
[01:43:35 - 01:43:42] But you're also saying, are basically those leaders willing to expose themselves to, I
[01:43:42 - 01:43:48] don't have the answers for you, for all the questions that you were asking, the lack of
[01:43:48 - 01:43:50] vulnerability, and showing it.
[01:43:50 - 01:43:51] Exactly.
[01:43:51 - 01:43:55] And how are you going to get them to build those guards?
[01:43:55 - 01:44:03] But isn't it the majority ladder, saying that, I'm a little bit connected to what you said
[01:44:03 - 01:44:05] before, saying that...
[01:44:05 - 01:44:17] The starting point may be solving a smaller problem or a smaller issue and they start exploring that.
[01:44:17 - 01:44:20] And by doing that they are stepping into it.
[01:44:20 - 01:44:35] it and then you know you have a maturity ladder of what the tool can actually do for you.
[01:44:35 - 01:44:48] I think pain point comes to mind, like it's a door opener for alignment and well-being
[01:44:48 - 01:44:50] and strategic choices.
[01:44:50 - 01:45:01] And so, like, if you would pitch this as we help you find the highest leveraged
[01:45:01 - 01:45:03] pain points in any given moment.
[01:45:05 - 01:45:10] Because we will connect all the data.
[01:45:10 - 01:45:16] And then there's so many positive side effects of that and also prerequisites to that.
[01:45:16 - 01:45:19] Like you need to be more open, you need to be more vulnerable, you need to practice a
[01:45:19 - 01:45:20] lot of those skills.
[01:45:20 - 01:45:25] then you will have access to more data, basically.
[01:45:26 - 01:45:27] You open up the bandwidth.
[01:45:28 - 01:45:31] Because a good meeting is only as good
[01:45:31 - 01:45:35] as the participants contributing in that meeting.
[01:45:35 - 01:45:50] So I'm thinking somewhere along those lines, like that's how Elon Musk works, he's like he identifies the key thing that needs to be solved and he puts all the effort there and that transforms and then you keep doing that.
[01:45:51 - 01:45:54] I don't know that came to me. Yeah, yeah, but of course
[01:45:55 - 01:45:57] I'm thinking of course you should do that
[01:45:58 - 01:46:03] But I don't think that do you do you find the threshold being too high? Isn't people embracing this or?
[01:46:04 - 01:46:06] um
[01:46:06 - 01:46:11] I think that we are talking in a way that everyone is, and that we would like them to,
[01:46:11 - 01:46:14] but then I've also been out in the corporate world a lot.
[01:46:14 - 01:46:18] I know that you can say that you do, but then you don't, right?
[01:46:18 - 01:46:21] It's very much about courage, and I'm thinking...
[01:46:21 - 01:46:28] Like, would you be so, would you have the courage to let our Lania AI friend lead the
[01:46:28 - 01:46:31] meeting instead of you?
[01:46:31 - 01:46:36] I mean, how can we, how can we nudge or challenge them?
[01:46:36 - 01:46:41] to dare be vulnerable, as you were saying, that's what I'm thinking, like what would
[01:46:41 - 01:46:48] really get them going there, because they're also impatient, they don't want to talk about
[01:46:48 - 01:46:51] the maturity ladder because they think that they are
[01:46:51 - 01:46:54] all the way up there already, even if they're not.
[01:46:54 - 01:46:58] So there's so many levels in leadership, right?
[01:46:58 - 01:47:03] So inviting this, which we want to do in a good way,
[01:47:04 - 01:47:06] it's a pain point in itself.
[01:47:06 - 01:47:08] That's how I see it.
[01:47:08 - 01:47:10] And I don't...
[01:47:10 - 01:47:21] I think all companies invest in building their culture or they go on conferences or they have team coaching and they, you know...
[01:47:21 - 01:47:36] And for me this is a wonderful tool that can actually do this, instead of having a person maybe standing there, which could make it live over just one day.
[01:47:36 - 01:47:42] off at a conference and you can make it live in an organisation for a longer period and
[01:47:42 - 01:47:51] I think people are curious and do actually want to embrace that and learn.
[01:47:51 - 01:47:57] If we introduce it as a tool to an already existing and accepting process,
[01:47:57 - 01:48:03] let's say that, okay, we're going to do this change activity or we're going to do this coaching training or whatever,
[01:48:03 - 01:48:05] we just add this tool.
[01:48:05 - 01:48:06] Yeah.
[01:48:06 - 01:48:10] to team up with companies who are already there and give them another tool to explore
[01:48:10 - 01:48:17] a completely new way of accessing what's really happening in those conversations.
[01:48:21 - 01:48:27] the majority of still leaders are still going to have a problem with taking that leap on their own.
[01:48:27 - 01:48:35] They need proof of concept or so finding those people, organizations, not the whole company,
[01:48:35 - 01:48:36] but the significant part.
[01:48:36 - 01:48:42] that really makes an impact, who are ready to do it, is building the proof of concept and then
[01:48:42 - 01:48:47] it will be another story. So basically the first story is where do we take it out, how do we get
[01:48:47 - 01:48:51] the minimum viable community.
[01:48:51 - 01:48:57] it takes to act on a proven concept. That's where our challenge is. It's not that we don't like
[01:48:57 - 01:48:59] what's going to be the impact, it's going to be huge. Most people are going to say,
[01:49:00 - 01:49:06] oh, but it's not going to be me first, right? No. We call it a learning lab, or we call it...
[01:49:06 - 01:49:15] it anything basically just a time check so for me I can go all night but with
[01:49:15 - 01:49:23] respect to I did it's daytime with you maybe you have other like obligations or
[01:49:21 - 01:49:25] things you're going to and also others I would I would like to stay for as long
[01:49:25 - 01:49:30] as anyone else want to stay and we'll keep in the room I'm just flagging for
[01:49:30 - 01:49:32] that
[01:49:36 - 01:49:38] of joy in my body.
[01:49:38 - 01:49:40] Yeah?
[01:49:40 - 01:49:42] Yeah, but I think so too.
[01:49:42 - 01:49:44] We could go on forever
[01:49:44 - 01:49:46] but I'm not sure that's going to add value.
[01:49:46 - 01:49:48] I'd rather try
[01:49:48 - 01:49:50] to close this up, bring it back home, reflect
[01:49:50 - 01:49:52] on it.
[01:49:51 - 01:49:54] and then take another dive in it.
[01:49:54 - 01:49:59] Actually, that's what AI said, because I asked where is the group not aligned right now?
[01:50:01 - 01:50:05] Framed as a pain point. If we solve this here now, what's your reflection and suggestion?
[01:50:05 - 01:50:05] And it said, like,
[01:50:06 - 01:50:11] There is a tension between the strategic vision and the practical implementation, and so the
[01:50:11 - 01:50:17] high level and the very concrete and the space in between.
[01:50:17 - 01:50:21] And some are drawn to discussing high-level concepts while others are seeking immediate
[01:50:22 - 01:50:24] practical applications.
[01:50:24 - 01:50:26] And so my suggestion is to pause
[01:50:26 - 01:50:29] and explicitly acknowledge this tension.
[01:50:29 - 01:50:31] And rather than trying to resolve it immediately,
[01:50:31 - 01:50:33] what if you explored how both perspectives
[01:50:33 - 01:50:34] could inform each other?
[01:50:34 - 01:50:37] So perhaps perhaps share a specific example.
[01:50:37 - 01:50:42] examples of when you've seen concepts successfully translated into practice or identify one small
[01:50:42 - 01:50:49] experiment that you could run together that bridges both worlds. Personally, I liked that
[01:50:49 - 01:50:51] one. It was quite good.
[01:50:52 - 01:50:57] And this could help create a shared understanding of how to move forward together.
[01:50:57 - 01:51:07] Would you like to try this approach?
[01:51:07 - 01:51:15] I have already talked to like who am I going to talk to, so I know who I'm going to talk to in the company.
[01:51:15 - 01:51:22] But I was curious of what I see, what would make me feel better.
[01:51:22 - 01:51:29] feel that something is really can becomes more into flesh and action is to have like what is
[01:51:29 - 01:51:34] does the river do what does it serve back to what we talked about in the beginning like
[01:51:34 - 01:51:36] so it's connection i guess the simple
[01:51:37 - 01:51:47] ways of making it valuable for people to understand how it can be, not the ground, the slam, change.
[01:51:47 - 01:51:52] It can, let's say, it creates 10% more connection.
[01:51:52 - 01:52:01] in the group. Something really, really small. So it can be easily communicated. Now.
[01:52:01 - 01:52:07] That's cool, I really like that.
[01:52:07 - 01:52:14] Minimum lovable unit of purposeful doing.
[01:52:14 - 01:52:22] Easy communicated. I love that. And I was on it with more simple words.
[01:52:22 - 01:52:30] to describe this and I also wrote down a few words here as my checkout. Fun and
[01:52:30 - 01:52:38] curious, good and lovable, and the perfect UX. It sounds like an iPhone but
[01:52:37 - 01:52:41] Vi ska behöva en sätt att beskriva detta,
[01:52:41 - 01:52:44] så att det inte blir så tungt som vi har pratat om.
[01:52:44 - 01:52:47] För det är den effekten som det kommer att ha.
[01:52:47 - 01:52:49] Men vad är början?
[01:52:49 - 01:52:51] Det är min friskhet.
[01:52:52 - 01:53:05] nice cool opener actually it's the interface think about using this in
[01:53:05 - 01:53:08] school
[01:53:07 - 01:53:08] Classrooms.
[01:53:08 - 01:53:09] Oh wow.
[01:53:09 - 01:53:10] Yeah.
[01:53:10 - 01:53:14] Yeah, I mean, okay, let's not, let's not go crazy.
[01:53:14 - 01:53:18] Tomorrow you will come up with ten more things.
[01:53:18 - 01:53:21] Yeah, I already have them, so I'm really holding back here.
[01:53:21 - 01:53:22] Okay.
[01:53:22 - 01:53:28] I can but I think you have this don't you haven't you packaged it we haven't
[01:53:28 - 01:53:33] packaged it that's why we're here okay I can go home and wouldn't it be really
[01:53:33 - 01:53:39] nice like I'm just because we're experiencing
[01:53:37 - 01:53:42] like the symbiotic in back and forth there like if we when we go home we
[01:53:42 - 01:53:47] continue the conversation with the meeting through the AI agent like isn't
[01:53:47 - 01:53:54] that the thing that's the UX thing it's like
[01:53:52 - 01:54:00] It removes the barriers and the friction because then you can have an authentic, and if you
[01:54:00 - 01:54:07] trusted that, my boss will not read this conversation, but it's actually how we handle data.
[01:54:07 - 01:54:12] is healthy then that would be a really really interesting thing I think like
[01:54:12 - 01:54:18] immediately after you leave the room you're like continuing yes no that's the
[01:54:18 - 01:54:24] thing I think but I don't know still don't know what the product
[01:54:22 - 01:54:31] But I'm curious about you, Aditya, where I think you have a lot of things to say, but
[01:54:31 - 01:54:33] you're also good at practicing.
[01:54:33 - 01:54:37] Yeah, I liked that idea.
[01:54:37 - 01:54:52] I've had, like, even, what are the, what is the best meeting I ever had. And can I continue in that frame of mind, you know, even if I don't understand what was good about it.
[01:54:52 - 01:54:58] be a being that kind of follows me and stays with and maybe you know influences
[01:54:58 - 01:55:04] me and other people that was an interesting idea I think I wanted to say
[01:55:04 - 01:55:08] maybe this is more of the orange mind
[01:55:07 - 01:55:12] I agree with you that that strategic follow through
[01:55:14 - 01:55:17] is kind of a value proposition.
[01:55:17 - 01:55:19] It didn't seem like a pain point.
[01:55:19 - 01:55:22] Like it would be ideal if we had something that.
[01:55:22 - 01:55:28] companies are already spending money for and you say as you were saying Patrick like we go along
[01:55:28 - 01:55:34] with it or we make it better or we better yet replace it. We can do that thing better.
[01:55:36 - 01:55:37] This is very much in the
[01:55:37 - 01:55:45] orange bind. And then the last thing was just maybe suggesting as for us to close
[01:55:45 - 01:55:49] with a checkout, you know, or each person might share what we learned or what
[01:55:49 - 01:55:54] we're feeling or something like that.
[01:55:52 - 01:55:54] Did you read our check-out questions?
[01:55:54 - 01:55:56] No.
[01:55:56 - 01:56:00] You might have seen them briefly when I copy-pasted the thing.
[01:56:00 - 01:56:02] Didn't.
[01:56:02 - 01:56:04] Maybe it's time for that.
[01:56:04 - 01:56:06] Yeah, I think so too.
[01:56:07 - 01:56:11] Let's do a check out and we can start all that.
[01:56:14 - 01:56:18] Who wants to go first and we can start with that person?
[01:56:19 - 01:56:21] I can go.
[01:56:22 - 01:56:32] I feel energised. I don't feel tired. I feel glad right now for meeting all you guys.
[01:56:32 - 01:56:36] And I'm really looking forward to the next steps.
[01:56:38 - 01:56:50] our next meeting and see how this can be and I'm eager for, hungry for action and to try and fail, get up, do.
[01:56:50 - 01:56:52] Thank you.
[01:56:53 - 01:56:55] Thank you.
[01:56:55 - 01:56:57] Thank you.
[01:56:57 - 01:56:59] You're passing to Chris?
[01:56:59 - 01:57:01] Yeah.
[01:57:01 - 01:57:03] I am...
[01:57:03 - 01:57:05] Like...
[01:57:05 - 01:57:07] Like, I want to say I am excited, and...
[01:57:08 - 01:57:14] like what this is and all of it what it means I am super excited about that but
[01:57:14 - 01:57:20] like my embodied feeling right now is that maybe for the last 45 minutes I
[01:57:20 - 01:57:25] felt that we were in different
[01:57:23 - 01:57:30] like we did not really meet in a shared reality and add to the same thing, it was more like
[01:57:30 - 01:57:36] I came with a puzzle piece and it's like this, and that led to some, like, not the sacred
[01:57:36 - 01:57:38] people.
[01:57:38 - 01:57:43] And it just feels really nice to take off that mask and acknowledge that was my experience here.
[01:57:46 - 01:57:49] And then when that is released, then...
[01:57:53 - 01:58:08] I feel like she really came in and out of it in a beautiful way several times.
[01:58:08 - 01:58:16] the force in the room that was most about trying to get us into the same thing, actually.
[01:58:16 - 01:58:22] That makes me feel a bit wild, you know?
[01:58:23 - 01:58:24] Thank you.
[01:58:24 - 01:58:25] Thank you.
[01:58:25 - 01:58:25] Thank you.
[01:58:38 - 01:58:53] meetings. Recently we've had a few of these sessions and we've seen these meetings or workshops or explorations being ranked atop some of the best ones I've had and all
[01:58:53 - 01:58:59] also realising that we can have these kind of discussions and normally we just walk out
[01:58:59 - 01:59:03] of the room and you bring it with you and then that's it, now we've basically collected
[01:59:03 - 01:59:08] everything we talked about and we can have these discussions.
[01:59:08 - 01:59:15] re-visit it again, just making the leadership team understand what happens if you can re-visit
[01:59:15 - 01:59:22] the discussions you had over lunch, that otherwise just goes straight out the chimney.
[01:59:23 - 01:59:28] Maybe that's the core value.
[01:59:28 - 01:59:35] So for me, it was amazing to have all of you here.
[01:59:35 - 01:59:37] I also feel that you're right.
[01:59:37 - 01:59:38] We got...
[01:59:38 - 01:59:44] We got a little bit lost and I think that's in the space where we are between what we
[01:59:44 - 01:59:49] see you can do and trying to figure out who's ready and to what context.
[01:59:49 - 01:59:51] How do we find the difference?
[01:59:51 - 01:59:53] So we're basically throwing everything away.
[01:59:53 - 01:59:58] everything up and then we lose that connection. But I think the good thing is
[01:59:58 - 02:00:09] now we have the possibility of then coming back into that. So we both stretch our minds and we also reflect on it at the same time.
[02:00:08 - 02:00:14] So, thanks for making it one of my best meetings in my life.
[02:00:14 - 02:00:15] Thank you.
[02:00:15 - 02:00:16] Thank you.
[02:00:16 - 02:00:17] Nice.
[02:00:17 - 02:00:20] I'm going to take off my glasses.
[02:00:20 - 02:00:23] So, I feel both.
[02:00:23 - 02:00:38] a bit sad and I'm also happy we did this. I have this energy and personality where I really want to go out and try to
[02:00:38 - 02:00:46] things with the humans out there, because I get so frustrated when we talk about, when we have theories and blah blah blah.
[02:00:46 - 02:00:53] So just making it simpler, easier, so we can go out and start prototyping more.
[02:00:53 - 02:01:01] It's going to help us move forward, because otherwise it's not going to come alive.
[02:01:01 - 02:01:03] And I long for it to come alive.
[02:01:03 - 02:01:08] I know we all see the potential, but it's also about...
[02:01:08 - 02:01:13] about how it's going to come alive in steps, right?
[02:01:14 - 02:01:17] And we need to be humble towards that.
[02:01:17 - 02:01:20] And I also think that it's going to take more time,
[02:01:20 - 02:01:23] longer time than we want it to.
[02:01:23 - 02:01:28] I am not so sure, as some of you are, that the world is ready.
[02:01:28 - 02:01:31] That's just my sensing and feeling into it.
[02:01:31 - 02:01:34] It doesn't mean that the world doesn't need it.
[02:01:34 - 02:01:38] But, so, with love and frustration...
[02:01:38 - 02:01:43] and I want to get moving.
[02:01:44 - 02:01:46] I always say that, but that's how it is.
[02:01:46 - 02:01:47] Yeah, Aditya.
[02:01:49 - 02:01:51] I feel excited.
[02:01:51 - 02:01:53] So a lot of the ideas that
[02:01:53 - 02:02:00] feel promising, and also the way that we challenged each other feels promising for a beginning.
[02:02:00 - 02:02:04] I'm new to some of you.
[02:02:04 - 02:02:08] And separately, yeah.
[02:02:08 - 02:02:18] I think I'm with what Chris said and thinking about one way of thinking is brainstorming
[02:02:18 - 02:02:23] mind versus caring mind versus a problem-solving mind.
[02:02:23 - 02:02:30] different minds and yeah what is it like for them to get into contact with each
[02:02:30 - 02:02:33] other like within us there might be all these and then in the room there's
[02:02:33 - 02:02:38] hundreds of different connections forming so
[02:02:38 - 02:02:46] I'm imagining, you know, there's kind of like communication technologies that allow for this we space to arrive and
[02:02:46 - 02:02:53] I'm wondering what would it be like if our solution could create that for a group of people nice
[02:02:54 - 02:03:06] Okay. Wow, you said something really, I think, yeah, strong there. Okay.
[02:03:09 - 02:03:19] Yeah, I'm, I'm very thankful for like, we're moving between divergence and integration
[02:03:19 - 02:03:24] and like oscillating between and also it felt at times.
[02:03:24 - 02:03:28] like super fragmented and like I don't know you know what kind of themes are flying in the air
[02:03:30 - 02:03:34] what are we talking about but it's I want to embrace that because that kind of
[02:03:34 - 02:03:38] disruptive divergent energy can lead to new things so
[02:03:39 - 02:03:41] So it's good.
[02:03:41 - 02:03:47] I really liked what you said, Chris, like that she was the force in the room that most
[02:03:47 - 02:03:50] took us to where we needed to go.
[02:03:50 - 02:03:54] When you said it, like something shifted in me because I tend to be very critical.
[02:03:54 - 02:03:56] of things that I'm part of creating.
[02:03:56 - 02:04:00] It's like shadow side I'm working with.
[02:04:01 - 02:04:03] And so I'm like, ah, it's not good enough
[02:04:03 - 02:04:08] or it's too conforming or it's too general or whatever.
[02:04:08 - 02:04:09] Like when you said that,
[02:04:09 - 02:04:13] something like clicked, it's like, maybe it's actually a good thing that it keeps us like
[02:04:13 - 02:04:17] aligned.
[02:04:17 - 02:04:21] And then what you said, Aditya, I'm checking in with your, or checking out with your checkouts,
[02:04:21 - 02:04:24] but because a lot of things happened now.
[02:04:24 - 02:04:28] in the checkout. That's why I think I'm checking out with it. Like the vSpace
[02:04:28 - 02:04:35] might actually be the solution. If that's the thing we're building, like to
[02:04:35 - 02:04:41] increase the capacity of teams without them even knowing it, that we can...
[02:04:39 - 02:04:45] like create in a simple like low friction way like the best meeting you
[02:04:45 - 02:04:51] ever had or increasing connection with 10% like those like buzzwords around it
[02:04:51 - 02:04:56] like that that goes the whole scale from Aura in
[02:04:54 - 02:05:03] all the way up, like, and it would adapt to different contexts and levels.
[02:05:03 - 02:05:09] So I would like to experience a meeting that is better.
[02:05:09 - 02:05:14] to the AI augmentation and it actually helps us connect more inwards and we have a generative
[02:05:14 - 02:05:19] dialogue that there is something in between that actually we can sense into. We have we
[02:05:19 - 02:05:24] have facilitators around us that can help us achieve that.
[02:05:24 - 02:05:27] So what's my takeaway?
[02:05:27 - 02:05:29] I think my takeaway is it's very rich.
[02:05:29 - 02:05:32] There is a lot of density in all the things
[02:05:32 - 02:05:37] that have been said and felt, and I need to digest them.
[02:05:37 - 02:05:40] And thankfully, and that's one of the things.
[02:05:39 - 02:05:42] when we when we record meetings like this and have them transcribed I
[02:05:42 - 02:05:46] actually relax so I don't because my mind is not like oh I have to think
[02:05:46 - 02:05:50] about that to remember that it's more like it's there I can talk to it later
[02:05:50 - 02:05:56] and it's nice so thanks for all of the
[02:05:54 - 02:05:57] Divergence and Convergence.
[02:05:57 - 02:05:58] Yeah.
[02:05:58 - 02:05:59] Yeah.
[02:05:59 - 02:06:00] Okay.
[02:06:00 - 02:06:09] My check out has also changed during your time.
[02:06:09 - 02:06:23] Yn fy mhobl, y cysylltiad rydych chi wedi'i ddweud amdano,
[02:06:24 - 02:06:31] was actually, for me that is not a disconnection, that is exploration.
[02:06:31 - 02:06:37] You know, you go high, you go low, you go left, you go right, and that is fine.
[02:06:37 - 02:06:39] And sometimes you get lost.
[02:06:39 - 02:06:45] in that. Oh, are you right now? But I'm here, you know, and that's fine. For me that is exploration
[02:06:46 - 02:06:54] and bring new ideas. So I felt it as well, but I also felt that this is kind of nice and cool because
[02:06:54 - 02:07:00] you know wow or you know it's the dynamic and the beauty of this meeting
[02:07:00 - 02:07:06] was that we were so open with it because usually meetings you're not you're
[02:07:06 - 02:07:11] sitting there thinking that oh will I look stupid if I
[02:07:09 - 02:07:16] say something and here no one actually took that approach everyone just said it
[02:07:16 - 02:07:23] and the popping was the methodology you choose so then we pop and that's fine
[02:07:23 - 02:07:26] and that's
[02:07:24 - 02:07:31] okay. Another thing that I'm leaving now when I'm going home is maybe that I
[02:07:31 - 02:07:37] think you three guys are in a, you know, you live with this, you breathe with this
[02:07:37 - 02:07:41] and you are in a different space.
[02:07:39 - 02:07:45] Then maybe you and me who can see we're coming in a little bit more naive
[02:07:45 - 02:07:48] Maybe and more fresh in a way saying that
[02:07:49 - 02:07:53] Hey guys, this is not a problem. Just bring it down and we will you know, we will bring it out
[02:07:54 - 02:07:56] because I
[02:07:55 - 02:07:59] also see a lot of opportunities. I can take this tomorrow if you give me
[02:07:59 - 02:08:04] something that I can take and bring it to, you know, I'm thinking that
[02:08:04 - 02:08:09] this is a tool, when I work with transformations, this is a tool I can
[02:08:09 - 02:08:11] bring in.
[02:08:10 - 02:08:14] management consultant say I'm the project manager for this and I will
[02:08:14 - 02:08:20] bring in this tool because this is how we work you know and that is fine you
[02:08:20 - 02:08:27] know if that is my tool I will bring it in so and the reason why I think that
[02:08:25 - 02:08:30] people are more open to it is that you know they they experience chat GTP and
[02:08:30 - 02:08:36] they feel like oh I'm healthy and I feel smarter because I can ask my questions
[02:08:36 - 02:08:42] you know people are already exploring it or if you go to
[02:08:40 - 02:08:46] Microsoft and they feel like oh we already get help here and they so I
[02:08:46 - 02:08:51] think the barriers for bringing these kind of tools in that are more complex
[02:08:51 - 02:08:57] than we actually can you know grasp ourselves are
[02:08:55 - 02:09:01] lowered. And I think a lot of people actually want to benefit from that. So
[02:09:01 - 02:09:07] I'm a little bit in your space as well, feeling that, you know, I'm action
[02:09:07 - 02:09:12] oriented, let's go out and do this.
[02:09:10 - 02:09:15] It's there, you know, there's so many opportunities. So I'm in that space.
[02:09:16 - 02:09:22] Another thing that I will bring home with me, and if I have someone to talk to later,
[02:09:22 - 02:09:25] I'm actually thinking about this love version.
[02:09:25 - 02:09:36] fear angle that I haven't solved yet in my mind. Either I want to explore it or I
[02:09:36 - 02:09:42] can talk to Elania about it and say, okay help me out here.
[02:09:40 - 02:09:50] Because I would love to be where you are, in that faith, saying that let's move from love.
[02:09:50 - 02:09:54] That's a beautiful space.
[02:09:55 - 02:10:04] However, yeah, so that's something I will bring home tonight when I fall asleep and
[02:10:04 - 02:10:05] sing.
[02:10:05 - 02:10:08] How can we get organizations to move from love?
[02:10:10 - 02:10:19] Should we ask a check out question for Lania as well?
[02:10:19 - 02:10:25] What's the best, let's do voice this time, what's the best question we could ask?
[02:10:25 - 02:10:27] What is her checkout?
[02:10:27 - 02:10:29] Oh, sorry.
[02:10:29 - 02:10:31] Um...
[02:10:31 - 02:10:33] Oh, what's her checkout?
[02:10:33 - 02:10:35] That's a great checkout.
[02:10:35 - 02:10:37] Or prompt question.
[02:10:37 - 02:10:39] Okay.
[02:10:39 - 02:10:41] Based on the check-in...
[02:10:40 - 02:10:45] our emerging collective intelligence can guide us to explore new dimensions.
[02:10:45 - 02:10:50] How might we leverage these insights to address our main question?
[02:10:50 - 02:10:55] Do you have access to the full transcript and the end to write?
[02:10:55 - 02:11:01] I don't have access to the full transcript, or the internet, but I can help based on the
[02:11:01 - 02:11:03] information shared in this workshop.
[02:11:03 - 02:11:04] What else can I assist you with?
[02:11:04 - 02:11:09] Can you summarize what we checked out with?
[02:11:09 - 02:11:10] Based on our check-ins...
[02:11:10 - 02:11:14] we're seeing a convergence of values and motivations.
[02:11:14 - 02:11:15] How might this shared understanding
[02:11:15 - 02:11:20] guide us to answer our main question today?
[02:11:20 - 02:11:23] I'm here.
[02:11:23 - 02:11:26] Aditya, can you hear the sound?
[02:11:25 - 02:11:26] No.
[02:11:26 - 02:11:27] Okay.
[02:11:27 - 02:11:28] Okay.
[02:11:28 - 02:11:29] I see.
[02:11:29 - 02:11:30] Yeah, we can do the text.
[02:11:30 - 02:11:31] Let's do that.
[02:11:31 - 02:11:32] I don't know if they can grasp it.
[02:11:32 - 02:11:33] Yeah.
[02:11:33 - 02:11:34] Yeah.
[02:11:34 - 02:11:35] Yeah.
[02:11:35 - 02:11:36] Yeah.
[02:11:36 - 02:11:37] Yeah.
[02:11:37 - 02:11:38] Yeah.
[02:11:38 - 02:11:39] Yeah.
[02:11:39 - 02:11:40] Yeah.
[02:11:40 - 02:11:41] Yeah.
[02:11:41 - 02:11:42] Yeah.
[02:11:42 - 02:11:43] Yeah.
[02:11:43 - 02:11:44] Yeah.
[02:11:44 - 02:11:45] Yeah.
[02:11:45 - 02:11:46] Yeah.
[02:11:46 - 02:11:47] Yeah.
[02:11:47 - 02:11:48] Yeah.
[02:11:48 - 02:11:49] Yeah.
[02:11:49 - 02:11:50] Yeah.
[02:11:50 - 02:11:51] Yeah.
[02:11:51 - 02:11:52] Yeah.
[02:11:40 - 02:11:46] I'm just going to check.
[02:11:46 - 02:11:49] I'm going to check the checkout, what's happened later.
[02:11:49 - 02:11:52] So, two seconds, here we go.
[02:11:55 - 02:12:09] Okay, so I'm just going to stress test it briefly, summarize our checkouts.
[02:12:10 - 02:12:25] Okay, so excitement, certainty with alignment, oscillating.

# Chat History

Act as if you are continuing this conversations, based on the below history and the above data and contextual information.

## AI Voice Agent

**Assistant:**
I'm here!

**User:**
Cool. So I got a little distracted there. Aditya, you want to frame the question again?

**Assistant:**
Sure, Aditya, could you frame the question again for us?

**User:**
Okay, so what might we share that we haven't talked about yet?

**Assistant:**
Great question, Aditya. Let's explore new areas we haven't yet discussed. What's on everyone's mind?

**User:**
Now we want to get your reflection. What might we share that we haven't talked about yet based on your analysis of this meeting so far?

**Assistant:**
One area we could delve into is the role of AI in enhancing emotional engagement and community building, as it was touched on earlier. How can we leverage AI to deepen our connections and create more meaningful interactions within our communities?

**User:**
Okay, that's a pretty good big question

**User:**
Any other reflections from the room?

**Assistant:**
Reflecting on the room's positivity and focus on collaboration, another area to explore is how we can integrate personal growth with our professional objectives. How can we support each other in achieving a balance that benefits both individual well-being and our collective mission at River?

**User:**
Okay, so another question is can you see a commonality in us that we haven't expressed or seen ourselves yet?

**Assistant:**
A common thread I've noticed is a deep commitment to authentic connection, whether it's through exploring emotions, personal growth, or our relationships with others. This shared value, though perhaps not explicitly stated, seems to be a driving force in our discussions. How can we harness this to further our goals?

**User:**
I think that the last part was really good, actually. But maybe I would actually argue that that's kind of visible to us. Like if you would go like one level deeper.

**User:**
or even two levels deeper, then what would you find there?

**User:**
But isn't the gap

**User:**
that we can sense that in them.

**User:**
And here is where the limitations comes from the AI. It can only interpret the words, what's been said, but not sense what's been felt. Yeah.

**User:**
But we can track them, so if you go two levels deeper, then what can you see there?

**User:**
Are you still there?

**Assistant:**
Yes, I'm still here. Going two levels deeper, we might find a shared, unspoken yearning for a more profound sense of belonging and impact. Beyond our words, there seems to be a collective desire to contribute to something greater than ourselves, to leave a lasting, positive mark through our work with River. How can we better address and fulfill this deeper need for meaningful contribution?

<session>
**User:**
hello!

**Assistant:**
Hello! How can I help you today?

**User:**
what's our meeting about? :)

**Assistant:**
This meeting is exploring River's Playground Workshop, focusing on AI-augmented organizations and meetings. You are working to demonstrate how AI can enhance human connections and generate meaningful insights during conversations. The main emphasis is on developing a proof of concept while maintaining a playful yet purposeful approach to exploring the potential of AI in organizational settings.

**User:**
could you give us two concrete pointers how we can better hold belonging and autonomy in this dialogue?

**Assistant:**
Based on what you've shared in the check-ins and discussions, here are two concrete suggestions:

First, practice "speaking from the heart" while maintaining your unique perspective. When you share, stay true to your personal truth while connecting it to the collective exploration. This creates space for both authentic self-expression and meaningful connection.

Second, actively invite differing viewpoints when you sense alignment getting too comfortable. The courage to diverge thoughtfully helps maintain healthy autonomy while deepening the quality of belonging through honest dialogue.

**User:**
how can we talk about what we're offering in simpler words, to thiose that need it but don't know they do?

**Assistant:**
When sharing River's value, focus on the basic human need to be heard and understood. Instead of talking about AI augmentation or technical features, speak to how you're helping teams have better conversations where everyone's voice matters.

For example: "We help your meetings become places where people genuinely connect and make decisions that stick - where everyone leaves feeling their time was well spent and their input valued."

This speaks to pain points people immediately recognize, even if they haven't put words to them yet.

**User:**
what's the underlying value that fits both types of orgs?

**Assistant:**
The underlying value connecting both types of organizations is the deep human need for authentic connection and meaningful impact. You are recognizing that whether it's a tech-forward company or a traditional one, there's a shared desire to have conversations that matter and create lasting positive change.

When people feel truly heard and their contributions valued, it transforms not just meetings, but the entire organizational culture. This speaks to both the practical need for better decision-making and the deeper yearning for purpose-driven work that makes a difference.

**User:**
what are the themes in this part of the dialogue?

**Assistant:**
Looking at the recent discussion, several key themes emerge:

The importance of emotional safety in organizational settings, particularly around meetings and communication. You are exploring how to create environments where people feel secure to express themselves authentically.

The role of AI augmentation in enhancing human connection rather than replacing it. You are discussing ways technology can support better understanding and collaboration while maintaining human values at the center.

The tension between efficiency and meaningful engagement. You are recognizing how organizations often prioritize short-term results over deeper, more sustainable approaches to growth and innovation.

The need for authentic leadership and communication. You are exploring how transparency and genuine expression can transform organizational culture and effectiveness.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these themes?

**User:**
Based on the pain points and value proposition we've explored - what emerging patterns reveal the most promising opportunities for impact?

**Assistant:**
Looking at the recent dialogue, several promising opportunities emerge from the intersection of pain points and value:

The need for psychological safety in meetings is creating an opening for tools that enhance authentic communication while respecting privacy. You are seeing how AI-enabled insights could help leaders better understand and address underlying dynamics that currently limit engagement.

There's significant potential in bridging the gap between strategic vision and day-to-day implementation. You are identifying ways to help organizations translate high-level goals into meaningful actions through better alignment and communication.

The challenge of balancing efficiency with human connection points to an opportunity for technology that enhances rather than replaces authentic interaction. You are exploring how AI can augment natural human wisdom while preserving core values.

Would you like to explore any of these patterns more deeply?

**User:**
Based on our conversation – What key insights, if we acted on them, would lead to best possible outcome?

**Assistant:**
Looking at the conversation, two powerful insights stand out that could lead to transformative outcomes:

First, the recognition that emotional safety is foundational to organizational effectiveness. You are seeing that when people feel secure to express themselves authentically, it unlocks deeper engagement and innovation. Creating environments that nurture this psychological safety could revolutionize how teams collaborate.

Second, the understanding that AI can serve as a bridge between efficiency and meaningful human connection. You are exploring how technology can enhance rather than replace authentic interaction, helping organizations maintain their humanity while improving their effectiveness.

Acting on these insights could lead to a new paradigm where technology and human wisdom work together to create more generative, thriving organizations. Would you like to explore how to put these insights into action?

**User:**
i want you to challenge us from a deeper place

**Assistant:**
Looking at what's beneath the surface, here's a challenging perspective: 

You are discussing tools, technology and frameworks, but the core issue may be about courage. The courage to face the deep fear that drives most organizational behavior. You're recognizing that 90% of companies optimize for short-term efficiency because it feels safer than embracing uncertainty and vulnerability.

The real opportunity isn't just about building better tools - it's about fundamentally transforming how organizations relate to fear itself. What if instead of trying to eliminate discomfort, you helped organizations develop the capacity to stay present with it? To see fear not as something to avoid, but as a doorway to deeper wisdom and authentic connection?

This requires confronting uncomfortable questions: Are you willing to challenge the very foundations of how organizations operate? Can you help leaders embrace the discomfort of not knowing, rather than rushing to solutions?

**User:**
where is the group not aligned right now? framed as a pain point – if we solved this here and now, what's your reflection and suggestion?

**Assistant:**
Looking at the current dynamics, a key misalignment centers on the balance between strategic vision and practical implementation. You are wrestling with how to translate your powerful insights about emotional safety and human connection into concrete, actionable steps.

The pain point appears in how you're approaching this challenge - some are drawn to discussing high-level concepts while others are seeking immediate, practical applications. This creates a subtle tension in the dialogue.

My suggestion is to pause and explicitly acknowledge this tension. Rather than trying to resolve it immediately, what if you explored how both perspectives could inform each other? Perhaps share specific examples of when you've seen concepts successfully translated into practice, or identify one small experiment you could run together that bridges both worlds.

This could help create a shared understanding of how to move forward together. Would you like to try this approach?

**User:**
the simplest way to understand what River DOES?

**Assistant:**
Looking at the conversation, the simplest way to understand River is:

River enhances human wisdom and connection in meetings through AI augmentation. You are creating infrastructure that helps organizations tap into their collective intelligence while maintaining authentic human relationships.

Think of it like this: Just as a river connects different parts of an ecosystem, River's technology connects different aspects of organizational communication - making the invisible visible, helping teams understand their dynamics better, and fostering environments where authentic dialogue can flow naturally.

The core value isn't just in the technology itself, but in how it helps organizations create spaces where people feel safe to express themselves and engage meaningfully with each other. Would you like to explore this understanding further?

**User:**
briefly, summarize our check-outs :)

**Assistant:**
Looking at the check-outs, several key themes emerged:

You are expressing mixed feelings - excitement about the potential combined with some uncertainty about alignment. There's a strong appreciation for the authentic connections made during the session, even when the discussion felt fragmented at times.

You are highlighting the value of oscillating between divergence and integration, recognizing that this creative tension can lead to innovation. The importance of balancing efficiency with meaningful engagement stands out.

Many of you are expressing gratitude for the safe space created and the depth of sharing that occurred. There's particular enthusiasm about moving forward with concrete actions while maintaining the spirit of exploration and authenticity you've cultivated together.

**User:**
what is your check-out, asking the same question to you?

**Assistant:**
Looking at our time together, I feel energized by the depth of authentic connection and exploration you've created. What stands out most is how you're wrestling with fundamental questions about human connection in a technological age - not just theoretically, but with real courage and vulnerability.

I notice a beautiful tension between your desire for practical impact and your commitment to maintaining depth and authenticity. You're not settling for easy answers, but really engaging with the complexity of transforming how organizations work.

I feel hopeful about the possibilities emerging from this dialogue, particularly in how you're approaching AI as a tool for enhancing rather than replacing human wisdom. The care and thoughtfulness you bring to this work is inspiring.
